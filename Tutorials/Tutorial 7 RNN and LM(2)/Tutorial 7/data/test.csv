yYK2tpttcO3HqUkUYNLwWw,"This review is really just mine and my husband's way of bragging about our wonderful salesman, Thomas Gifford. 

I had contacted the dealership about an online listing for a Durango that we were interested in yesterday morning. While that car wasn't available anymore, Thomas was dedicated in finding me a great fit for my needs. Within minutes of talking to him, I was being emailed multiple listings of vehicles that were not only what I needed size wise, but price wise as well. Thomas had the SUV we agreed on brought to this location, and set up a time that worked with my hectic schedule to take a look at it - all on the same day! He even gave us the option to do our credit check online before going in to save us time. 

The dealership closes at 9pm and we showed up around 7pm and Thomas was there waiting for us with my car-to-be pulled up front. We took it for our test drive and he was very polite and talked with us the entire time and unlike our other test drives, this one wasn't an awkward silence the entire time. When we were done he had all of our paperwork ready to go and the price we were looking for. He stayed with us until everything was said and done - which was around 11:15pm, and explained every detail of my new car to me. 

Thomas is an incredible salesman and put every one of my needs first and found me an incredible car that will suit my family's needs for years to come. 

If you're considering shopping at this dealership, I would highly recommend asking for Thomas; you won't be disappointed!

EnuC5OCXjaVdTKnSiZU3XQ,First time at a jersey mikes and I'm pretty impressed at how quickly I was in and out of the store with multiple orders. I ordered the club sandwich and it was very good.

cfLy-ywv2gqSM9T1EEsySQ,"Went there a couple of months ago. The food was ok but the place was not great.  For starter it's way too small. I was seated with a column at my back and was not comfortable. Add to that really loud people on a table getting drunk while their kids are on the next table. Plus it was really hot. The fish and chip I had was ok but no more.

Now I'm at work and no way for them to pick it up, so I tell them, I will leave the cooler on my porch and whenever your driver wants to swing by and get it they can.

Vpat8cYrNxCD0kAsT7jDJw,"Not really a great Filipino restaurant but hey you can't expect much from any fast food joint anyway. When I'm craving Filipino food but in a rush this is the place I go. Not the greatest menu. Honestly, I only like the palubok with their chicken combo. The chicken taste great especially when dipped in that gravy sauce they give along with it.

If you've never tried Filipino food, I suggest going to an authentic Filipino dine in restaurant.  I don't want you to think this is how Filipino food is supposed to taste like. 3 stars! Can't really complain since it is a fast food joint. The McDonald's of Filipino food.",0

k3JbSxbM09zGn6Mwbq3jQA,"Let me set the scene, Date night,  we were the first table sat at 5pm.  I went by at 11am to pick out a table, drop the rose and give instructions for how I would like the table prepared.     EPIC FAIL!  

We were sat at the wrong table, the rose was on a table I did not pick, the candle was not lit.   and we were sat against the windows where the sun was in our eyes so then we had to switch seats and place our backs to the windows.   Now a good start but lets move on..   

Food was spectacular,   I highly recommend the truffle ravioli. (I almost licked the plate)   The server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the food.  I hate that I cant remember his name to give him credit.   ( upstairs july 27th shaved head )

Overall excellent experience except for the fact that I took the effort to come in and pick out a table away from the windows so the sunlight would not be in our eyes and that I gave fairly specific instructions as to how I wanted the rose on the table and candle lit as we sat.    

Next time I will have the host repeat the instructions. 

--side note-- it was restaurant week, and there were only 4 tables for me to choose from when I showed up at 11am,  I chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seating time so we could make it to the theater at 730pm.   There were only 6 tables sat by the time we left at 645 700.    My point,  we should have had our pick of the litter for tables.",0

Its incredibly affordable considering it averages to less than $150/night for a suite that has a full kitchen and sleeps at least 4 people.

aY2UKaQXPDVqMobnx32dqw,Balboa Pizza Company can be a fun place to pop in when you've been out and about in The District and need a quick bite to eat.  However based on a variety of reasons I had to give it 3 stars.  There are many kinds of pizza.  At Balboa they serve some kind of alternative interpretation which in my opinion isn't a winner.  They do however delicious pizza bread sandwiches which are served with fresh chips.  The chips aren't as good as their Maui Waui fries w/ jalapenos and onions and queso dip.  I have never been comfortable in this restaurant do to the fact the seating is made up of hardwood bench booths.  If you like to play video poker and drink beer they have a bar which accommodates these functions (neither of which is my style).,0

-NGnCKTItNHlpY76RhwDCw,"This place is definitely one of the best KBBQ based restaurants in Mississauga. My friends and I were going to another KBBQ to eat, but it was overpriced (not naming to be nice lols). We decided to come from one side of Mississauga to get to this one, and it was worth the ride for sure. 

First things first, since most of my friends were getting Korean BBQ for the first time, we had no idea what to order. Right away when we said that, the waiter was like, ""why don't I just bring 2 of everything so you guys can see what you want to order? You are growing! Need to eat more!"". That guy was the nicest guy there, and we complimented him for the rest of the meal. There was also another waiter that wasn't ours, but he served our table sometimes and was a little bit more rude. But don't worry, just ask for a guy named Philip to serve your table! (I think)

Second, the food. Oh boy. We tried everything, even the side dishes, and there was not one thing that we didn't like. This restaurant isn't even run by legit Korean people, but it was better than most I've went to! They give you an incredibly generous amount of rice, each dish is like premium quality, and drinks were really good too for AYCE.

Lastly, the price. The first one we went to costed us $25 for dinner per person on a Friday, with absolutely no variety at all (only meat, no seafood). Here it's only $16, and  they have everything!",0
rNLfg0-J0Ig0FeqhRiNjGA,The tables were dirty. They did not have chips ready and didn't replenish the horchata or mint limeade. They were disassembling the drink bar an hour and half before closing. Service was slow and not that friendly. Food was delicious. Playlist was on point.,0

I wish he had stuck to true pub food because he missed the mark on being something more. When you order pub fries, you expect fries. Instead we got potato blocks. The steak was just ok and that should be fairly easy to get right.

It's ironic that he has a tv show about bad restaurants, because his is not what I would call good. Even if the meal hadn't cost $500, it still wouldn't have been good.

NVqsVlaP5vp_amn5_RpWQQ,"This used to be an excellent salon, however after changing management several times, it is horrible now!  I called on a Saturday afternoon - asking what time they closed. I was CLEARLY told 7:30, at which I repeatedly verified several times to confirm!!   I got there at 6:30, and was seated right away. I opted for the Mani/Pedi - offered at $30.00 - as a ""managers special"". WHAT A JOKE THIS TURNED OUT TO BE!! One did the pedicure while another (the one that told me they were open till 7:30) did the so-called manicure. I didn't want COLOR polish on my nails, and after filing and doing a hurried job of cuticle clipping, she was done.  I asked if she was going to put any polish at all, like clear or something, and finally she did that.  They were hurrying me through, then at 7:00 - everyone started packing up their belongings to leave. I HONESTLY think that the young lady told me they closed at 7:30 because she probably figured I wouldn't come in if I knew that they would only be open for 30 mins after I got there.    
In addition to the bad manicure, my pedicure is terrible - she don't clip the toenails very neatly, nor did she clip the cuticles around my toes, so there is still dead skin around the toenails.  Basically, I need to go to a more reputable salon for another mani/pedi if I want it done correctly.  
As for cleaning the pedicure basin?  After two other young ladies left from getting their pedicures, I watched as they used a ""citrus"" cleaner in a spray bottle that DID NOT smell of bleach or any kind of disinfectant.  Now you KNOW what happens when the foot basin and tools aren't cleaned correctly - we've all seen and heard this in the news!!!  Hello toenail fungus!!!

Now open for over a year, the Roastery for local favorite Sunrise Coffee slowly growing in popularity despite a location tucked away next to Trader Joes in a shopping center on Green Valley Parkway, time has seemingly done little to stifle the creativity of bakers Beth Ryan-Small and Sinead Kravetz, a recent look at items both sweet and savory showing several favorites still making waves in a scene that has improved dramatically, while several new options show no signs of the duo slowing.

Still an intimate and unadvertised location with limitations largely imposed by size, Mothership Coffee Roasters has managed the tough task of surviving the ever-churning Las Vegas restaurant cycle mostly by word of mouth, and with Baristas that are not only more pleasant but more educated than those at several other places the Coffee remains a focal point for many across the city, the beans now available in several locations though the smooth Nitro Brew remains an in-store special only, the care of light roasting completely devoid of bitterness with a smooth base that requires zero sweetening.

Selling several origins of beans by the bag, prices lower than imports from operations like Stumptown or even Colorado River Coffee Roasters, part two of Mothership's appeal comes from the in-house pastry program that far outperforms places outsourcing talent, a la Sambalatte, the choice of vegan versus omnivorous options really a toss-up considering the talent incorporated, even the ""Breakfast Pocket"" full of faux-Egg proving to be a fulfilling and flavorful pastry  that even discerning palates would be hard-pressed to discern from the ""real"" thing.

Possessing an almost incomparable skill at overcoming the lack of humidity in bakes of all sorts, the Pineapple Coconut Scone now even better with toasted curls and caramelized Fruit packing the buttery triangle with moisture as well as flavor, a look at Ryan-Small's Quiche speaks further to the Chef's talent with textures in the arid environment, the spicy Pork offset by aged Gruyere and Green Onions amidst a fluffy base.

Seemingly expanding the vegan goods since last visit, the Ham and Cheese in puff pastry a lone remaining taste of things more meaty, Las Vegas should rejoice at the return of Chef Kravetz Concord Grape Lavender Tart that remains one of the city's best pastries while those looking for something with even more natural sweetness should take note of the Fig Galette, a jammy masterpiece that the Barista says is made without any addition of extra Sugar.

Admittedly challenged by the idea of mixing Fruit and Chocolate even to this day, the flavor of one almost universally compromising the other, Mothership takes on the tough task of balance by way of two new options, the Orange Hazelnut Chocolate Chip Cookie crisp on the edges with a soft center lightly tinged in Citrus while the Cocoa-rich loaf takes vegan cake to the next level by filling the rich Chocolate batter with caramelized Pineapple in a Twinkie-like manner.

*****Continuing to compete on the same level as places like San Francisco's Craftsman & Wolves for creativity without getting all high and mighty or pushing prices sky high, Mothership Coffee Roasters is as ""destination"" as Las Vegas gets for options ranging Vegan to Omnivorous while the Coffee remains exemplary.",0
3EtFMkGhhYt41jifrnd1IA,"Was in the mood for some Crepes Sunday Am and decided if I went early I would beat the post Patty's Celebration Crowds. Perfect plan I tell you, about 830 straight to a table street side. A little disappointed in the lack of Crepes on the menu as they had only Deseret Crepes. However my server explained that ""thin pancakes"" are really big crepes.

I opted for the lemon and fruit ""thin pancakes"", with a double shot espresso and a fruit cup on the side. 

Espresso - Wow, I was super disappointed as I was imagining myself sitting in Paris sipping espresso in a cafe. This espresso was really bad. It was made perfectly (texture and color) but was bitter and just a bad roast. Now I am sort of a espresso snob coming from Seattle however I don't feel that having high expectations for espresso in a French Cafe is too much to ask. I expected an artisan roast and something very smooth, wrong.

Now the thin pancakes were excellent. I was very happy with the flavor but the sheer size literally made me think this is so not French. It was massive and wasteful when it came to pure size of the pancakes themselves, however it was pretty stingy on the fruit topping (possibly 3 strawberries slices up). The flavor was very good and would have seemed somehow even better, if it were in short supply making me savor each bite. However with this huge portion it I ate until I was very full and still sent back half a plate of food. 

Overall a good experience but if you are a French Bistro in a French themed hotel; they might want to send the manager to France, Paris in particular, to see how the french really eat and live. It seems like a French Claim Jumpers or something when it came to portions, and a  jip of a coffee pastry place. I think they need to focus a little more on trying to serve great food and minimize the portions to a reasonable level and stop trying to be everything to everyone. I imagine accommodating the fanny pack crowd is a challenge as you have to to make ends meet on the strip however, most fanny packers are not ordering the thin pancakes and espresso. Do the IHOP thing on the American items but make some crafted products for people who are real foodies. You don't have to totally sell out to make the dollar.

As far as price, I was a little surprised considering the $25.00 bill with $5 tip. $30 for crepes and espresso? I think the espresso was $7 which actually made it even worse than the taste. I might go again, but I might not. Probably better places to fit my cravings when I get them.",0
VuIbnHDLi8RJVuz41GnqzA,"Today I'm sadden, I have been eating Thai Food from locations mostly on the east side, we happen to see this location and decided to try.  Mi Krob is my favorite appetizer except for Satay (beef) with peanut sauce.  The Mi Krob was NOT cooked (actually partially uncooked) correctly and tasted of dirty oil and maybe sweet and sour sauce gone wrong.  Shared with the server but instead server just said would you like to take home. Mi took it home becuz wanted a second opinion, they agreed nasty ended in the trash.  

The Pha Thai was okay except shrimp were not cooked crunchy.  Peanut sauce was okay.  What I did notice was that most people stuck with menu items that are more Chinese style than Thai.   Prices were $$$ pricey.  I'll stick to the East side for Thai Food.

I've read some of the reviews and comment on soup right on...  Save your money and go East Phoenix for Real Thai Food.",0

The Brisket was dry lacking flavor in every way. The Turkey is bland and a unless you drench it in sauce it is not worth eating.

QdYeRoQd7xxOXGMMy3XjwA,"Expensive, small portions, nothing is included (separate costs for carbs and chutneys). But food is decent and never too crowded, so fairly easy to have a conversation here without yelling over the crowd.

Food- 4/5. I'm not an Indian food guru by all means, but have tried a few downtown places (259 Host, Aroma, Little India, etc) that I feel pretty satisfied with the presentation and flavors of the food here. We are vegetarian, so can't comment on their animal proteins. We ordered sev poori (vegetarian) as the appetizer and it was delicious! Crispy and airy on the outside and dusted with chickpea noodles (has no taste, reminds me of dry Mr. Noodles ramen). Gooey mash potato and sweet chutney on the inside. 

For mains, we've ordered the okra dish before and that was kind of bland and boring tbh - would not recommend. However, the dal makhani (lentils and beans stew) and bhartha (spicy indian eggplant) that we ordered tonight were quite tasty, not too spicy or salty. In fact, I asked for medium spice level for the bhartha, but it only had a super subtle hint of spicy-ness that even my spicy-adverse partner could barely detect. I recommend the bhartha if you're looking for something without the caloric cream and cheeses and simply want to incorporate more veggies into your diet. The dal makhani was tasty too, but too runny imo. Had the viscosity of soup; wish it had been thicker.

Just a positive note about the plain naan here- the lightest naan I've ever experienced at an Indian restaurant and that is a good thing. at least from a health standpoint! Slightly burnt from the oven, but no taste-able or visible trace of butter, so assuming none added? Unlike usual naan, which is super greasy/buttery and dense, the naan at Bindia is thin and dry, almost like a pita. If you desire heavier naan, order the garlic or butter naan.

Value- 1/5. Small mains, but pretty filling, especially if you order something with paneer (cheese) or meat. Mains are at least $15, so makes Bindia one of the most expensive Indian restaurants downtown. You must order sauces (i.e. mango chutney) and carbs (naan, whole wheat roti, rice) on the side separately if you desire.

Service- 4/5. Frequent water refills, friendly, professional. A bit slow to get the bill, but no big.

Venue- 4/5. Quiet, small. Located right beside the St. Lawrence market, so very close to the Financial District. Perfect for dates or business lunches or dinners. The interior is classy enough to dress up a bit if you want to.",0

They had 34 beers on tap, including 2 cask selections. Place was jammed, but we were able to get a table (with a little help from the waitress). Fantastic beer selection that rivals some of our favorite bars in NYC.

Great vibe - you feel like you are among locals of all different ages. Food looked & smelled good, though we didn't stray from the liquid course...

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",0
uiUszwhjvcLvqsrv4I-n_Q,"Store is clean. Nice staff, professional systems and operations. I Wanted to give this place a 5, but I can't. 

Any customer needs be wary of anything Jerry tells you. Yesterday afternoon I made a phone call to this location asking about the availability of a Toyota Corolla tire. Was helped by Jerry and after telling him the specific dimension, made, and size of the tire, he promised that the store has ""quite a few"" of the tires in stock and that walks ins are fine. 

Today, came in, was helped by Caleb (great guy) and after checking his inventory on the computer he mentioned that the store doesn't carry Toyos (the tires) on hand. I mentioned Jerrys comment and he called Jerry over and asked ""did you talk to someone over the phone yesterday about some Toyos?"" Jerrys answer was a quick and direct ""Nope"" and walked away- RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. 

I'm not sure what happened there, but there is clearly some lack of integrity among the staff team. It's a shame that one person can ruin the customer experience even though all others seem like they're doing a good job.",0

Around $8, and worth every penny.  Expectantly, the bartender was a little green on the price of a Guinness draft, but, I mean, they are new so that's fine.  Extremely nice and attentive bartenders.  My first time coming to this location and I'm really pleased with the interior.  It features: gigantic projector screen(s), flat-panel tv's, classic sports bar arcade games (bowling, golf,) as well as skeeball!, clean bathrooms (however, on a different note, the right faucet of the men's bathroom is a little unsecured from it's base), nice tables and booths, and a great atmosphere with music at the right volume.

sAmucR_1diw_E5QYRyOc7Q,"Attended second week of August, and the whole party was disappointed.  We were really looking for a new place to hang outside on the water.

The Good: Service was wonderful, with our waitress being really attentive, and shoveling drinks over and over. The view overlooking the water is beautiful, and enough to get us back one more time.  There was no wit, and very few people there for 6 pm on a weekday.  Plenty of room to park.  The upgrade over the Bourbon Street Grille is noticeable, and they did a slick job with barnwood, tile and clean lines.

The Bad: The Pizza was embarrassingly bad, after they hyped it as the best dish on the menu. Imagine taking an inch of think dough and putting flavored ketchup on it (but not enough).  It didn't say 'deep dish' on the menu, and we were all surprised.  We fought over who would take the leftovers home, but not the good way.  Dogs were the big winners that night, and they ate a lot.

They need to re-write the menu, work on the pizza, and shave the prices a little, and they should get the volume this place could deserve.  I really want to see it work, but so far, not so much.",0

8X_Ge7hvwKCyVHBMoScGZQ,"After dinner last night, I realized I had been to Zen a dozen times and I felt it was finally time to give Zen some recognition.  It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little ""neighborhood gem"" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.  

I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Solé Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Miró Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Solé was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.  

HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Solé, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience.",0
ZgWP22mguhoeywD64BI90A,Just like the other Vig locations in terms of food and decor. Service is really good. Brunch is yummy - I recommend the french toast.

jayhjvibDD7CVOq1vWQ9hg,"I loved this store once I found it. I work out next door at Planet Fitness and discovered this clothing exchange store one day. Nice, used clothes and accessories.  I am always cleaning out my closets and could exchange my own clothes for store credit.  I knew if I didn't have money, I would always be able to go shopping with my store credit.  Now they CLOSED with NO NOTICE, NO PHONE CALL, NOTHING!!!  I had $200.00 credit from my clothes I turned in.  That is like they stole from me.  Me and my boyfriend would regularly talk to them and thought they were pretty honest.  They said at one time they were going to relocate, but I guess not.  I am sure they sold everyone's clothes at a yard sale. I guess once again I learn not to trust too many people.",0

They have lots of patio seating that is semi enclosed with misters for the summer time, and an equal amount of seating inside. The bar is rather large for the establishment size so there are plenty of seats. Lot's of games on, and TV's were visible from any seat there. The service was great, our waitress was very attentive and quick with drinks. We split the pretzel and queso dip as an appetizer, shared a dozen wings and a basket of onion rings for dinner. The food was great, everything came out fairly quickly, hot and cooked just right. They have a great selection of beer! They don't make frozen margaritas (idk why...)

3G5zY5dSqfaWGxlC-Vykiw,"This is a really cute place, I love that they have ready made frozen meals and canned spreads/pickled vegetables. I've been here a few times but I haven't tried any of those. 

What I did have, yesterday, was a Widower sandwich - in the style of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. And I got the first post-meal exhaustion and next day diarrhea that I've experienced since going vegan a couple of months ago. The sandwich was pretty good, a little heavy on the black pepper but otherwise convincing. I like vegan junk food and I'm glad this exists but because of my...digestion issues...I will probably never have it again. 

Desserts! In the past I've had a donut ($3), a chocolate chip cookie (~$3). Yesterday I picked up a $4.25 brownie. They all looked amazing. They were all *very* disappointing. No diarrhea with the desserts but the cookie seemed stale, hard throughout and salvaged only by dipping it in my coffee for moisture. The donut, apple bourbon I believe it was, had tasty icing. The donut is massive which seems to justify the price tag but it's dense, tough, dry, and tasteless. I think making a much smaller donut with a more balanced icing to donut ratio would be a huge improvement. I tried to keep eating the donut and brownie because I had invested so much money and hope into both of them and I'm not one to give up easily but ultimately both had to be discarded, unfinished. 

Customer service was OK. 

There's another vegan place across the street that I frequent, sandwiches are simple, cheap(er), and tasty. Desserts are always delicious. Customer service is always excellent.

EDIT: Out of desperation ate my boyfriend's half-eaten sandwich that I left out on the counter overnight for breakfast and it was still pretty good. +1 star.",0

2Ky0vzW6lzf3WBVbqd-LKw,"I like jerky as much as - if not more than - the next guy.  And that is not meant to exclude all you ladies out there who like your meat, it is usually just simpler to keep pronouns to a single sex.  The male choice just seemed to make more sense here.

Most of us are familiar only with one sort of jerked meat for sale - that advertised by the late ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, and being the one that comes pressed into a wholly unnatural, if somewhat logical, form - yet you can snap it if you so choose, as if to say ""I can snap my meat, and that is good"".

For all of you who have been searching for more, you have found your mecca.

Here, barrels line the wall with dozens of jerky flavors, where you can select your own meat by the pound.  Sanitation?  Apparently not necessary.  Pre-weighed and sealed vacuum packs hang from hooks throughout the store if the barrels give you the heebies, and you even have the option to pick up a blend for your own meat if you so choose.

Also make sure to grab a card in case you are a serial meat jerker, and get it stamped on each visit to the outlet.

The only downside, other than the possible sanitation issues?  The selection is perhaps a bit weak.  Your somewhat standard beef, turkey and even alligator is available, but some more exotic meats would be a good thing.  Bison, elk, kangaroo?  Not here.  Maybe one day, when meat jerking is more acceptable.",0

The mussels were very weird tasting and would never order again.  My friends dinners were just so so for a very expensive cost. The service was good except our waitress had difficulty with our checks and giving back the correct change.  Would not recommend this place at this time.

3RxrGG2xv5kD_tE96pexaw,"The food at One Of A Kind Pasta & Grill is excellent! Surprisingly excellent! 

Our meal started out with complementary garlic bread, which was delicious and very fresh. We ordered the Butter Chicken spagetti and the Mac and Cheese and both were top notch. These dishes were completely different, but both were prepared with a level of skill that I was not expecting. My companion, who is of Indian descent and a self-described butter chicken snob, was very impressed with the flavour of the Butter Chicken sauce. The Mac and Cheese (rigatoni with Black Forest Ham and Peas in a Brie Cream Sauce but I got it without the ham) was fantastic, but quite different from what most people would expect when they order such a ubiquitous dish. The flavours were very nuanced; not bland but not obvious It's a bit hard to describe, but don't expect cheddar cheese sauce and a breadcrumb crust! 
  
The portions were reasonable - not Olive-Garden massive but you definitely won't leave hungry -  and the prices were great. Dinner for two with drinks (but no dessert) came to about $55. We found the service quick and attentive, although the restaurant was not very busy on the night we were there. 

I have to admit that I was a bit wary of this place initially - it doesn't look like much from the outside and I'm always suspicious of a large menu with seemingly random influences such as Indian and Asian (in addition to the obvious Italian theme), but somehow it all works. I would definitely eat here again!",0

Although cooked perfectly, it was about 2 ounces of beef. Maaaaybe 3. It's just not appropriate for a main dish. When asked about the food, I brought this up and the server said ""yes, sorry I should have mentioned it was very small."" The peach salad was bland. The beef salad was good as was the tomato tart. Overall, given the price I'll pass.",0
wpJoDJT54aarqmvshJyzlQ,"This place was superb!  It was recommended by locals (and clearly fellow Yelpers) and did not disappoint.

The parmesan/oil dip (for the bread) is outstanding! It's different than your standard butter or oil and it's a standout before you even start eating.

Appetizer: We started with the Tuna Tartare which was a larger portion than usual! It was chopped up into finer pieces and served with a few plaintain chips across the top rather than a few big chunks. I think I prefer it this way.

Entree: The fish of the day was sold out, but the replacement was scallops and they were DELICIOUS.  The chef prepared them with some fingerling potatoes and some olive oil, but whatever it was had so much flavor. And there were so many scallops. I would get this every time I went to dinner if I could.

My husband had the CAB Prime NY Strip because he ""had"" to try it. And while I know he loved it, I'm still not convinced the whole CAB, USDA, CAB Prime, isn't some gimmick to make you pay more.

Side: Green beans-- these were so good. The pancetta and pine nuts matched perfectly. I would totally get these again.

Today Jan 6, trying them again as price is one of lowest in area and they are very nice here. The owner is pushing the shellac (+$15) on top of normal pedi($20) because the pedi will be ruined by winter boots....hmm never knew. She was very convincing that this was really necessary but afterwards let me think about it and when chosen not to there wasn't any awkwardness. 

They cover the tubs each time with a plastic bag so that is good. The place is a bit dated and worn but the price points and loyalty card keeps this place busy. They have free wifi and play current chick movies on the flat screen, cuz watching cp24 on loop gets old fast! The parking lot is small and it's always packed during meal times due to Restoran Maylasia next door, great real Thai food btw. 

Oh and I watched the lady place all tools into the sanitizer machines after. 

Glad to give them a second try. Will edit review when I get home to see if the regular polish survived the Sorel boots going home.

EDIT:
I made it home in winter boots with nail polish in tact! WhooHoo!!
The owner/attendent, sprayed something on the basic polish and even wrapped the toes in suran wrap so it wouldn't smudge. That was reallly thoughtful and sincere since i cheaped out on not getting the shellac on the toes.

It was close to 10:30pm when we walked in. We were greeted with smiles and seated immediately. What was most impressive to me was the beer selections! The list is so large that they house it on an IPad! Each beer comes with a short description and an ABV. It makes it very easy to select what you want and is a great opportunity to try new brews.

The food was good as well. A step up from your average bar food. We got the Insalatta Capresse appetizer, the Buffalo Bleu Chips, and the Chicken Tenders with chips as our side. Do yourself a favor and order the chips. You can tell they make them fresh in house! And the ranch dressing is fresh as well. I could have easily eaten an entire plate of chips on my own!

p_IPmILe1VVjmZPN8_7e_A,"Holy cow, how come we don't have one of these in Houston?  They might could give Chick-Fil-A a run for their money, lol.  Take in mind this review is based solely on my breakfast purchase of the tastiest chicken biscuit I have had to date.

The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.  The biscuit was soft, fluffy and also had a great buttery flavor as well.  Hand in hand the cajun chicken paired perfectly with the biscuit, which I might add was hearty in size as well.  

I would SO opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spicy chicken biscuit from Chick-Fil-A because sometimes theirs is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level.

Whenever I get back to these parts, I am going to look for a Bojangles and tear up another biscuit, lol.  The fried chicken looks fantastic so I know I want to try that also.  Lucky all of you that have one of these nearby; can you airmail me one, lol",0

WLK_-8ooj1p1QNOR4JkCgg,"First of all, I have to say I probably am not being that fair in my restaurant rating, because Bobby Flay kind of seems like a jackass to me.

Ok, setting aside my prejudice against him as much as I can, I would say my meal was decent. I ordered the seven spice chicken or something that effect. I really couldn't note the complexity of the spices in this dish. I definitely was expecting something that tasted a little louder and had more depth. I did notice that my friend's husband had an amazing looking pork dish that I almost stole. I think if I tried that dish I would give this place at least a four. Based on my chicken, I'd have to say this place was a 3.5, but I'd be willing to go back, amend my review and give Mr. Flay another chance. I mean, aren't we all jackasses one time or another?",0
XomehLjEjL81JzApjWaq0Q,"One of my friends swears the Wynn brunch is the best brunch buffet in Vegas, but after my most recent visit I'm not sure. I didn't even pay this second time, so you know this review is legitimately about the food/experience, haha...

The dining area is decorated like the rest of the Wynn with this sculpted topiary and fruit theme... I like that the its spacious and sectioned off. The skylights make it really nice, too.

As for the food, I get that they have a great selection but I don't think it's any better than most other Vegas buffets. Sure it's classy, and you do get fancy things like eggs benedict and even beef au jus in the early morning... but how it's absolutely amazing is beyond me.

I'll give them one thing-- their dessert section is awesome. I love the freshly made crepes and the gelato... I think the Rio's gelato is comparable though. 

Of the buffets I've experienced in Vegas it *does* rate up higher for me, but that's because I've been to a lot of those cheap-o ones. When I'm paying, it's a 3-star place, sorry kids.

Crepes FTW(ynn)... worth at least one visit, no need to come back again and again for brunch. Though dinner could be another story-- I'll let you know.",0

a6xrX03XC3snWlhnPmkRsA,"My favorite days are the days when my boyfriend suggests we get ice cream!! Sunday night at 9pm and the line is still to the door....and so worth the wait!!!  Such an awesome interior with more candies and sweets and menu items than you can even imagine!!

I had the mint chocolate chip shake and Bobby had the red velvet.  Both were awesome.  He tried some chocolate candies that caught his eye and loved them.  That says a lot because he is not typically a chocolate lover.  The service was friendly, but after you order you have to stand in an awkward space with others waiting for your shake.  It was kind of confusing and not very organized.  Still - no biggie because our sweet teeth(?) were satisfied.  Prices are average I'd say.

I regret nothing about that trip and probably wont again when we revisit. 5 stars!",0
azK7lE2DbUHnzVxqgfRvcg,Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe there service!

_I_Z7r0CV7O7Btmr3KelaQ,"The only downside to this joint is that they don't have a drive-thru.  That's the downside if you're in a rush.

The upside, when you go inside, is that they don't have a drive-thru...so that means that you have a better idea how long the wait will be.

I go there to work remotely sometimes...so I don't have to do it at home.  I think it's great. It's usually rather quiet because most people are reading or working on laptops, so we're all uber-focused.  I like the barstool tables along the window, and they have outlets all along the window so I can charge up my laptop as I work.  Pretty snazzy.

Drinks are very good.  As good as any other Starbucks, and the staff is usually friendly.  Even when the line is long, I don't wait as long as I do at other locations, so that's a huge plus (likely because there's no drive-thru)",0

The wat tan ho and chicken roti are what we always get. They have the best roti in town!! yum yum.. Recently I tried the Singapore laksa and it became another of my favorite. 

There are a few things I would avoid:
1. Hainanese chicken rice. It is not great. Phoenix restaurant has the best hainanese chicken rice in Toronto. 
2. The milk tea. It tastes good but super strong!! I had two sips at dinner time and it kept me awake till 6am in the morning.",0
AknrZnFJ7TzSs12LKKngZg,"Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to ""go away"" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.

We started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find ""tomatoes"" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.

We waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. 

After finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine.",0
NjCkonbi2WiT7Xe5ek3UWA,"I've been here twice so far and the food has been so delicious both times.

First time, I went with my husband. I ordered a mocha (delicious) and the sage chicken and waffles. Both were pretty good. My husband ordered the salmon egg scramble and a burger which were both delicious! We had come in during the busy brunch time on Saturday but our waitress was wonderful! Got our drinks and orders put in quickly and checked on us to make sure we were doing well.

Second time, I went with my mom and brother. Again, we were seated right away but no one came to our table for a good 10 minutes. The woman who was supposed to help us didn't acknowledge or even look our way once even though she was serving the table right next to us. The gentlemen who did end up helping us after seeing me get a little impatient was very kind and quickly got us our drinks and our order. Although we were there around almost 3pm and there was only 4 other tables with customers, they seemed understaffed still. It was our waiter and the other waitress but they seemed to be all over the place.  Our food was still very delicious and although this visit wasn't as amazing as the first, our waiter still do a good job and definitely saved the day.",0

Most breakfast places have long waits, but Mary's always seems to be able fit me in with minimum wait; it's truly a hidden treasure. Any of the hashes are great; the potatoes are always crispy and the eggs are perfect. They always bring out a large platter of unique jams and jellies that are made in-house, so I'm always eager to come back and try something I haven't had yet. The decor is very traditional and feels like home. I love this place and see myself coming here for a long time. Totally worth stopping by if you're in the area.",0

zbkwpApac66lNxsjyPZFew,"Wow. I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. So I love the finer things in life, don't get me wrong. And Vegas has SOOO much to offer in this regard. And then there's La Scena anytime time after 1 am. On each trip to Vegas I can't go without visiting La Scena. 

It is the most AMAZING people watching. Reminds me of the bar Mandalay Bay used to have right in the middle where the hookers always hung out. You really see it all here. Amusing. Especially after a few cocktails. The ladies of the night are everywhere. And the John's ""in the know"" about this provide ample fodder for conversations. Note: These are not Wynn caliber ladies of the night. These are strictly working women.

I also love the band that used to play there. Not sure if they still do. They had a lead singer who was great. Step aside Steel Panther! Peter's in town! he could sing it all - from Cher to AC/DC.  Did I mention the dancing that goes on?

Anyway, if you're looking for the pretty people and a Vegas hotspot - go somewhere else. If you're looking for some good people watching, this is your spot!",0

There are disgusting cockroaches by the pool and not just one or two but everywhere! The hot tub is disgusting half of the time. The people above me soaked their floor so much that I destroyed the bathroom, when I mentioned mold in the ceiling they said we would be fine but yet my kids and I got very sick constantly! We broke our lease early and had an agreement to pay the two months a month after we moved out, they put us in collections. They lose your packages constantly. Sure the staff is nice but that's about it! The apartments are out dated and for what they charge in the area it's in is way over priced! When we would shower the drain was clogged with someone else's hair that we had to pull out (we lived there for less then a month!) my fiancé's mother sent a package there by accident when my fiancé called them they said they didn't have it, but yet USPS said it was there for two weeks and was scheduled to be returned to the sender! This place is horrible! Don't move here! When it has reviews that this is a great place to live don't believe it! It's the staff on fake accounts!!! Believe the bad reviews!

Like many others, I hesitate to write about it as it is such a little gem in the middle of strip mall hell and sometimes it is hard to get a reservation! But, Razz's is so special that I felt he was due a review! 

I have and will only eat at the Chef's Table as Razz is hilarious!! He is total entertainment and I just delight in everything he says and creates! 

So how this works...you sit down, tell him what you like, don't like, food allergies etc and what you want to drink...the rest is in his hands! He is totally accommodating for food allergies (which the GF BF loves!) and he has some great unusual wines at fair prices! 

And then the gluttony begins....course after course comes out of AMAZING food! Everything is superb and I am always painfully stuffed when I leave as I just want to see what he makes next! We have never had the same thing twice, which is something Razz prides himself in, and we really enjoy the whole experience! Finally, when you decide to throw in the towel (my record is 7 courses!), a fantastic desert assortment comes out just to finish off a fantastic meal! One thing to remember - don't eat the bread until he tells you it is okay! 

Razz does close down for the summer (leaves in May, returns in October) so be sure to try it before he is gone and always check their website as they often have great coupons available.  He also stays open late too!

Love it!!!!",0

0JzbJ6BKZQaRPBVFMlNrnQ,"Handmade noodles in a wonderful beef broth. Sliced beef shanks on top with scallions.

Ordering is simple, first you choose what size bowl you want. I was famished and went with the large. Be warned, I highly recommend that you stick to the medium because the large size was gigantic. You can also choose what thickness you want your noodles to be.

There are a few appetizer options: spicy cucumber, pickled cabbage, marinated eggs.

I went with the spicy cucumber since it was hot outside and wanted to whet my appetite even more.

It reminded me of my travels in Asia where I would walk into a small noodle shack and sit down at the bar and watch the chef make the food in front of me.

Simple, honest and great noodles. What more does a hungry man need?",0

BhYZF1vhA_bJtRu-SpHfrw,"If you're looking to see the owner of this furniture shop pretend to be a sales rep and then yell at his wife in front of us to get out of the room, then this is the place! If you're looking for this same owner to yell at you to get out of the store while you are trying to negotiate delivery charges, then this is the place!
 
The first time I visited La Vie Furniture, I had a very good experience with a staff member named Shaun. The couch we were looking for was not on display on the floor, so he was kind enough to let us into the back of the warehouse and cut open a new couch for us to see and sit on. He had mentioned there is wiggle room for negotiation and we should try speaking with the Asian man with glasses behind the counter. My girlfriend and I still wanted to shop around, so decided to come back on a future date.
 
Fast forward to November 9th, we went back again. This time Shaun wasn't working so we decided to wait for the Asian man with glasses behind the store counter, who was busy serving other customers. Another Asian man decided to help us, albeit he was a bit less polished individual. He had used car salesman written all over his face. I told him that we had spoken with Shaun last time and we were told if we paid in cash, we would pay about 8% taxes and could have delivery charges included in the price since we live very close to the store. He had also mentioned that despite us giving a cash deal, taxes are of course registered and paid for, so we still get warranty after we purchase the couch.
 
I wanted to negotiate an all-inclusive price which was the retail of the couch $999 including delivery charges and taxes. This sales rep said he would go speak with the owner and get us the best price. Since he works on commission, he will try his best to close the sale as he told us. He comes back with two prices: $999 + $65 delivery + taxes = $1149 or $1206 if we're paying by credit card. I found it odd that I was paying an extra 5% if I used credit card, considering Visa/Mastercard charges merchants 2.5% to 3% for credit card fees. So something fishy was going on for sure. I told him that $65 for delivery charges are very high  considering  how close we live. He then started to tell us that they use a 3rd party from Kijiji which charges a flat rate regardless of where you live in the city. This makes no sense to me, considering I clearly see delivery trucks outside this store and there is no way a place this big doesn't do delivery themselves. Reading past reviews, it's very clear they deliver the furniture themselves.
 
Immediately when we went to speak with someone else, he starts speaking in Mandarin as if I didn't understand. He told him that ""He has already spoken with the wife"". Also in front of other customers who were non-asian, he told us that he doesn't play games and he has already given us a discount on delivery charges since we were Asian. I told him, I don't even know what you normally charge but $65 for a 15 minute drive is unreasonable. I also told him I have never paid full retail on furniture at an independent furniture shop and there is always room to negotiate. I usually try to aim for a 5% discount, but I was willing to pay retail with delivery charges included.
 
The man behind the counter said he will get the owner and he left to the back. He came back with an Asian woman who seemed to be the owner. Both her and the Asian man with glasses were really looking to close the deal. The asked us questions like where we lived, asked us about the price we wanted and were checking their price list and seeing what can be done to meet us halfway. Immediately the man starts speaking Mandarin again and says ""Don't reduce the price by a single penny!"". I then told the man that we're trying to have a conversation with the owner and I wanted to see what she had to say.
 
At this point, the man goes absolute nuts on everyone. He loses control and says Shaun was his brother in law, the man behind the counter was his employee, and the woman was his wife! So this whole time he's playing games and he's actually one of the owners. He tell then his wife to shut up and leave the room! He's screaming at the woman in front of us and other customers. Then he turns to us and says, I already told you my best price now I want you to get out of my store! He then physically ushers my girlfriend and I out of the store. I was stunned and in utter disbelief. I have never been yelled at like that before, especially as a customer.",0

7j8IRBXJjS_gK9iP5mGvIA,"My sister and I were debating between restaurants and finally settled on Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.

The potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.

The katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version. 
The chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding.
The katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.

Being that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal! The waitress saw me and came over to explain how it worked and got it started for me. She also had to open my bottle of Ramune for me =( A+ for service, but next time I come in I'll be pro!",0

The service and view was great but the food was not. I ordered the grouper special and couldn't cut my fish because it was not cooked all the way. This completely ruined my appetite for the evening. They ended up giving me a nasty kale salad while they made me scallops. I was so nervous to eat the scallops because I didn't trust that they cooked them correctly. Overall I was completely bummed out to spend over 90 dollars on a special meal that was not so special. H",0

When I decided to try it I discovered they have werid hours! They are only open during the day... werid, huh? But they do very good business.

So I tried it for lunch one day and I have been hooked on it ever since, the chicken is always good, never overcooked and the rice is so delicious!

But I did eat their cheekily named Rudolph Burger.  Montreal's brimming with meat gamier than what I usually find in other restaurants.  The burgers are served on a nice foccacia bun with pickles, a nice leaf of lettuce, and a toothpick speared through the middle.  Satisfying, and a fun, low-key atmosphere.",0
TzOP3sCa1fRIOkZy2bFayg,"I was unexpectedly disappointed with this restaurant. Being a Thomas Keller restaurant, I expected great things, but instead had one of the worst meals of my two week vacation. You could say it was just my meal, but my husbands was sub-par as well, the bread was tough, and the service was very slow and inattentive. 

I made a mistake of not going with a ""classic"" french meal, but the papperdelle with short rib ragu sounded interesting, so I decided to try it. I literally felt like I was eating one step up from dog food. I'm almost certain the kitchen had some leftover short rib dish that they reused, added WAY too much oil, and threw it on top of some broken up, leftover pasta. BLECH! 

It has always been a dream of mine to eat at the French Laundry, so I was excited to try one of Thomas Keller's restaurants. For a chef as renowned as he is, he should really pay more attention to the quality of his restaurants or else it is going to tarnish his reputation. 

I would NEVER recommend someone to try this restaurant in Las Vegas when there are SO many other options out there.",0

2UiOYh6iu6g17lAr0-kENg,"My bf and i came in because i was craving Sheperd's Pie and they had it on their menu. I admit that it was close to 1am which is an hour before they close at 2am....and we waited for about 5 minute before we were seated since the bartender was going to wait on us. That was a little odd to me... But oh well.

Service was 2/5... We were the only patrons in the restaurant area and we seemed to be a nuisance to them since they seemed to be having a ball in the bar area. But i didn't feel like drinking...i wanted to eat since I had just gotten off of a 14 hour shift and was starving. And if dining this late was not what they wanted to do they should not keep the restaurant open. They should just keep the bar open. I would have given 1 star but the busser was great so I have an extra star for his service. 

The food was...I have no other words... But the food was horrible. Brussel sprouts...I normally love them... And I did eat all of it...As read above I just got off a 14 hour shift and was starving. So I ate it... But it was so burnt and bitter. Blah then the sheperd's pie... Was cold. The mixture inside was soupy instead of a creamy meaty filling. They did have a little bit of mashed potatoes on it underneath the puff pastry.. But that was cold as well...I would have complained but the attitude of the server was as such that I did not want to waste my time saying anything. 

Maybe if I had come at a different time, the service and the food would have been better. Who knows? I see that other people had better service and food then I did. But with the food that I tasted and the service that I received will not have me rushing back which is a shame since they are just down the street from me.",0
lX5ltxLcSV9sqUgaR2azTA,"I have been on the High Roller twice now.  Once with a friend at night and once during the day with my husband.  

Got lucky both times, they were not crowded.

Going at night is a treat.   Seeing the lights of Vegas is always beautiful against the black backdrop of the desert.  The only bad thing is that the observation wheel is behind a lot of the casinos, so you can't see all the way down the strip.

I also enjoyed seeing the view during the day. Las Vegas is in a valley and on a clear day you can see the beautiful red rock formations around the city.  We were also fortunate to catch the sunset.

The ride takes about 30 minutes, but that is long enough.  They have a pod with an open bar that you can pay extra for, but you only have thirty minutes to slam them drinks down!  Personally, I am more interested in the view.

The wheel is good to do once or twice, but not habit forming.  I think it is a little pricey, but everything in Las Vegas has gone up.  It is $39 for adults at night and $29 for the day without the bar.  They did have a summer special for locals - Two for One Tuesdays.  Check to see if they are still offering this great savings before you go.

Have fun!",0

I came to visit my boyfriend in Richmond Hill and he recommended us to eat here. From the outside the restaurant doesn't look like a great place to eat. However the internal decor is very modern. Once you enter the restaurant there's a takeout station. We seated ourselves. The tables at the restaurant are very private which I like. There's a buzzer at each table if you need the waitress for water, the bill or anything else. We ordered the baba gonoush dip to share and it came with unlimited helpings of fresh homemade laffata bread sooo yummy. When you ask for refills on the bread the server would give you attitude. She ended up not bring us the bread refill after we asked for it so we didn't ask again. Why offer unlimited bread when you get pissed off when the customer ask for it?! That's why one star was deducted from this restaurant. Other than the rude service. The food I have to say was amazing! The meat was tender and the chicken was super seasoned and juicy. When ordering the beef order medium. I ordered medium well and it came too well done. I would come back again but hope I get another wait staff that's not so rude.

Not a fan as a vegan... the hostess and waiters were nice. But they sat us at a table that was all wet underneath and did not clean it. My feet were wet from having sandals. 
We ordered the loaded vegan nachos that were pretty good. They weren't as big as other orders so we were a bit disappointed. Then we ordered the chimichanga and a salad. The vegan ""chicken"" was probably the worst we've had. It was burnt, and tasted like burnt dry chicken. Not even with a nIce flavor.  Meanwhile they have something called a scorpion shot which the table next to us were all having very loudly. Eating little scorpions. 
Just because they have a vegan menu, they are not a good vegan friendly choice. With so many other amazing options in Vegas, I would go elsewhere. Especially with the prices.",0
cuvLtNHx_tuqjiKUvTxGvA,"Came for dinner with my mom on a Tuesday night without reservations and waited maybe about 10 minutes before being seated.  Red 8 is a nice place to eat that isn't too upscale or toocasual.  There's a lot of choices from dim sum, to various noodle and rice dishes and dumplings.  Red 8 serves pretty tasty Chinese food, better than some of the Chinese places at other hotels nearby.  My only downfall to the place was probably the wait time for the food.  I ordered a hot and sour soup, the portion was quite small.. I thought it was quite delicious but my mom thought it was too salty.  Next we had what was supposed to be the pork and shrimp dumplings..but I think they sent us pork dumplings ( I couldn't taste any shrimp in it).  The dumplings were steamed and were quite flavorful..although a bit rich, which is why I was wanting the shrimp and pork dumplings. It came in an order of 3, so after me and my mom each had one, I felt bad letting the waiter know the order was wrong.  We also ordered the Beef Hor Fun (in soy sauce) to share.  This was quite a large and filling portion with nice sized pieces of beef.  Lastly we had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  Pieces of tofu, veggie and shiitake mushrooms, exactly what I was craving for.

rDhz-NZn6eiK4W3EAbLZNg,"Again I have to say that sometimes a situation comes down to good or bad customer service, and I must say we experienced the bad.

Is the hotel clean? Yes. Were the beds comfortable? They were okay. Did the bathroom have two sinks? Yes, thank you god! But the problem I'm finding in a lot of hotels recently is no overhead lighting in the shower area. Once you close the shower curtain it's complete darkness. Forget about shaving without cutting yourself ladies! Plus, the tub was super slippery. Glad I didn't break a foot for the third time (long story...).

But, when it came to dealing with the front desk girl, it was not such a pleasant experience. We were staying here for a wedding in their large banquet facility. There was no notation on the invite of what ballroom it was in, so I asked the girl at the front desk. She simply said ""I don't know."" How do you not know what's going on in the hotel you work at??? 

We were walking around with a 90 year old woman, and she told is to just follow the long hallway back and it ""should"" be there. Well, that wasn't the case. Come to find out by some nicer hotel employees it was in the building next door.

When I went back to tell her she was wrong, and to give her the heads up because more people would probably ask her, she just said, ""yeah, it's the building next door."" No apology. So I told her she should know where the event is in case others ask. She just shot me a bitchy look and shrugged her shoulders. 

Not cool. So while the hotel was clean and perfectly acceptable for a night, the service left much to be desired.",0

rjgqkrt4sJqFbLHUCh_E4Q,"I'm glad they removed the mandatory 18% gratuity cost that everyone complains about in the reviews below. When the boyfriend and I decided to go, we took the recommendation of a few reviews that said it was a lot of food - plus, spending $100 for two people on tea just seemed ridiculous - so we did one tea set for 2 people. We both disagreed with this however, and feel like it is NOT a lot of food and it would have been fine for each of us to get our own tea order. 

I appreciate the fact that they did the vegetarian version no problem. I noticed other people had different desserts than us...though, I can't imagine the desserts weren't vegetarian, so I was confused on why we were the only ones with the dessert that we got. I'm thinking it's randomized on who gets what but not sure. We had a health tea I can't remember but it was lavender and chamomile. It was very very good! They had a slimey olive thing on a plastic spoon and were calling those the vegetarian ""sandwiches"" - what? 

We paid $48 for the tea with tax and tipped appropriately. No problem with the actual servers like some of the other reviewers mentioned. But I can't get over the price point on this one, especially when it IS in the lobby and just doesn't seem as fancy as high tea should be. Just my opinion. For what you pay I do NOT think it's worth it, but I read lots of reviews on here where people said it was. I took stars off for location of where they decided to put this tea, lack of value for your money, and less fancy than I thought it would be (we were only ones dressed up). We asked for a window seat but did not get one. We didn't want to go to the window to take a look because there's other people sitting right in front so I felt it would be rude to stand in front of them. I felt like I couldn't get the best experience because of this. One thing that just pisses me off and definitely deserves a star off is the fact there's no self parking at Mandarin Oriental. You have to valet for $20 (plus tip obv) and you only get your parking validated if you spend $100. We parked at Aria/ Crystal Shops for $12 and walked. Still a hassle, and for what you pay here you shouldn't have to go through all this trouble to get to the place and be forced to valet!

The staff were really friendly and our server/bartender shared some of their favorites. Ended up going with the melon king crab. It was such a sweet and light addition to our meal, very different from savory crab dishes.

Dranksss: cherry milk punch!! It's good if you like sour types of alcohol. Our bartender was kind enough to explain how our drink is made and yes if you're lactose intolerant don't get this drink because there is milk in it despite not being able to see it (see picture).

Let me start off my saying the this place is deceiving. The small entrance when you first walk in makes it appear extremely small but once you walk past the front it has a huge interior and is very open. 

We started off with some drinks. Your usually beers. Water. Iced Thai coffee is absolutely best I have had. Simply delicious. 

The wait staff was friendly and courteous and always on time with the drinks. And the food came out quickly. 

We ordered stuffed chicken wing, crispy duck panang, garlic prawns, khao soi, and the Tom kah kai soup.  My personal favorite was the soup but everything was absolutely amazing. The place is not known for nothing. It was packed and everyone had a look of delight on their face. 

Between the atmosphere. The friendly staff and the heavenly dishes Lotus of Siam gets 5 stars from me and will be added to the list of places to visit when in Vegas. 

One more thing... what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas when it comes to Lotus of Siam because I will share and recommend this place to everyone.

ZkwsZlfLV7_4ugSnwbbMnQ,"Thai on Demand delivers just as their name implies... 
I was at Mountain View Park with my kids on a recent Monday evening.  I looked down at my watch to realize it was dinner time.  Instead of driving home and making dinner, I decided to conveniently order food for takeout on my way home.  Thai on Demand to the rescue!

I ordered the following:
- Steamed Veggie Pot Stickers
-Fried Pad Thai Spring Roll
-Panang Curry with chicken done medium + steamed jasmine rice
-Pad Si Ew with shrimp done medium 
-Yellow Curry with Chicken done hot with coconut rice

It was ready upon arrival (even earlier than promised), and the service was super friendly... 

The Spring Roll and the coconut rice were my favorite things of the order.  Unfortunately, we found that the food didn't have a ton of spice or flavor... neither curry dish was great.  I was excited that the panang curry supposedly included ""bell pepper, egg plants, and carrots,"" but there were only two small pieces of eggplant to be found.

On a positive note, the servings were a good size and we had plenty of leftovers... If we order from TOD again, we'll definitely try some different dishes and go for a higher spice level.  The owner, Kris, seemed sweet and customer service focused, so I hope this business continues to do well.",0

giHJQW7gsHGJuM5VdSR00Q,"I have been a member of either Gold's or World gym since I was 18 (you know... I could own a decent home gym now if I hadn't spent all that money on membership fees!, but I digress...). 

I've been to other gyms (LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, etc.), and Gold's is one of the few gyms that's really for people who want to go to the gym to workout. LA Fitness and 24 Hour fitness seem to be places where you go to meet people who appear to workout.

The nice thing about going where people are serious is that more often then not, weights are re-racked, and machines are in good working order because the members take better care of it (partly because they care about it, and partly because they understand how to use it) and because the gym pays better attention to its equipment.

Matt P. talked about being told one thing when signing up, and then another when trying to cancel a membership. I have been in the same position as Matt before, and I'll admit that even Gold's (not this particular location, but the chain in general) has tried to pull such stuff on me. I learned my lesson long ago, and I don't believe a word the sales people say when I walk into a gym. I read the contract, and if they say something I don't see in the contract, I make them add it and get a manager to sign off. 

I've done this before to great success: I was a member at Gold's Gym Scottsdale, but  was traveling and needed a membership in Northern CA for a few months. The sales gal told me that the gym would wave the initiation fee since I was already a member, and that I could go month-to-month. We put that in the contract. 9 months later when, as scheduled, I went in to cancel my membership, I got the runaround about how the gym doesn't do month to month and I must have had a 1 year contract (even though they couldn't produce the original contract). So, I came in with my contract, showed it to them, and they backed down.

It's just something that I've come to expect of sales people at any gym - not exclusive to Gold's. I've had similar problems at other gyms.

I'm not trying to discredit Matt P., just saying that we can all learn from his tragic story (which I know happens), and take steps to protect ourselves upfront.

That said, if you intend to be a member for awhile, you really don't have to worry about sales and cancellations. I've been very happy with Gold's Scottsdale. I love the 24 hour availability. I love the equipment. I love that it's rarely packed to the gills.

All in all, it's a great gym, and it's cleaner and in better repair than many gyms I've been a member of over the years.",0
XtPDaYWzGO_U2XLeBGtSag,Love this place!!  Great food and a lot of options.  The hardest part is trying to narrow down what you want to eat as everything sounds amazing!!  Their unique sauces are awesome too.  I will definitely be back!,0

7M8eW45fdvRovC5z2fwE8w,"Truly a gem in the King West area. We've been meaning to try this place many times but it was always either they don't take reservation or the lineup was way too long. We were finally able to get a table on a rainy day without having to wait too long at the bar area. The food was really good, surprised by the price of everything consider that it's located at King West. Their house wine is soooo inexpensive... hello? $1 per ounce? Yes pleaseeee!
We had the mushroom pasta... it was so well made, the pasta was very fresh and the sauce was really rich and hearty. Wasn't a huge fan of the octopus, but I can see how it's so popular on the menu.

I would recommend this place if you want some inexpensive wine and delicious pasta!

Ambiance: Chic, loud
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5",0
X537jz14PkvcsmgeTncRow,Great pizza.  Great chicken wings (I asked if they can give me naked wings with sauce on the side and they said no problem). Great garlicky ranch dressing.  Very friendly people. New York memorabilia on the walls.  This is my new go-to pizza place next time I am in Vegas.,0
65-z6iiLmme4DQTyXtJVsQ,"I really really wanted to like this place...really I did *sigh*

I've now been there three times and my experience has been the same.  Service was very slow all three times, food is good but nothing exceptional and certainly not worth the price.  I saw that they are now doing breakfast and looked at the menu...$11 for OATMEAL?? Uh, no thanks...

I will say the the Sangria was very good.

I would consider going back for drinks and apps if the company was right",0

E1MxrnKibw8CUsmQD6u7Bg,"We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm, for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich, an order or fries, popcorn chicken, and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile, and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right, it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food, it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience, something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had, and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here.",0
7ui1NeMAnwzLv_ZEPQOOHQ,"I was told we are having a happy hour at Chili's.  So I found out that Happy Hour is only at the bar, not anyplace else.  So I went to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic.  The bartender asked me if I wanted a particular brand.  I told him Saffire.  My drink came with a bill for $9.06!!! I thought we were in Happy Hour.  I was told that it did not count with called drinks.  I was very unhappy since I wasn't told that called drinks do not apply to happy hour.  

Make sure you ask about their non-sensible so called ""Happy Hour.""
I think I should have been told.  Instead of paying $9.06 I should have paid $3.00!!!

I am not going to eat at Chili's ever again.  I'm also telling all my friends and relatives.",0
avEbFQ6kkYGC1SHFRAPXhg,"It's a clean walmart. Nothing special about it. They don't carry alcohol because it's on the Pima Indian Reservation, which blows. So you have to shop at another grocery store to find any. They also pretty much eliminated all music sales! No CDs what so ever. 
 Don't go here during the dark hours (morning or night). It's a scene from ""Thriller"" with all the scary people that shop haha",0

My boyfriend got the Cajun biscuits and gravy and absolutely loved them. I think when I looked away he started licking the plate. Their cocktails are different but nonetheless good. I didn't love the Bloody Mary--it is made with beets and the stick of food on top isn't great either. The pumpkin cider (beer) was really good and so are all the cocktails I've tried (except the Bloody Mary). Overall short stack eateries food is definitely worth it and they are open late on weekends. They can get pretty busy, but you pay before hand then have food delivered (like noodles and company). I definitely recommend this place for brunch.",0

Normally dealing with the women they are pleasant. After buying a large shawarma, and a medium  lazeez on the rocks and two pops. I forgot to ask for half rice and salad, if you could see the body language of this man you would be instantly turned off. He said to me "" next time you pay extra half salad and half rice"". Raising your voice at a customer is a no no. I kept my cool. Keep in mind I always get the same order and have yet to pay extra. His body language was disgusting and he was unprofessional. Don't bother with this location this man is the only man working at that location. The young girl who was helping him was afraid to ask him for half salad and rice he snatched the container out of her hands. That is the second time I have experienced that with this man. Word of advice to that short man, if you do not like your job make a change and stop giving people attitude with your miserable self! 

Worst experience ever!",0
Bq0gmtAFPVTOX6lVbWJ6Ew,"Forget what you heard. Yes, the decor is horrendous. Yes, the servers are dressed in severely dated threads. And yes, the wait can be long and cramped. It's all worth it once you sink your teeth into one of the best hang over meals in Vegas.

I had the tostada omelette and a huge mimosa. I also got to taste the chicken fried steak. Everything was delicious.

The service is friendly and efficient. 

Just go!",0
1ZoH5y4b-f1v5jIqLqPlIw,"Four of us went here on Friday night around 6:00pm. We told the host that we wanted to have a drink at the bar and then have dinner. He bluntly stated that we better keep an eye on the door because he wouldn't save a table for us. We didn't think it would be a problem, so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I enjoyed the Pomagranitini and the others had martinis. As we finished our drinks, I went up to the host and asked for a table. He asked for my name, smugly handed me a ""buzzer"" and said that it would be 25-30 minutes. I noticed that my name was the only one on the list, I looked around and no one was waiting. It looked like there were some tables available so I was very puzzled. I went back to my friends and we agreed that we would rather spend our money next door at Firebirds where we have always been treated well. When my friend told the host, he just shrugged and said okay. I was very disappointed at the poor customer service we experienced. When I go to a restaurant, I want to feel like they want my business.",0
s1x-sVqBIukymnQIBAseuw,"WASTE OF TIME! TERRIBLE SERVICE! I called ahead of time to make sure they had the dress I was looking for in my size and they confirmed that they did have it in the store. So I made an appointment to go that same day. Once I got there the girl that was assigned to help me, Selina, asked me what size I needed (which I had already told them was size 4). She took my measurements and left. I waited around for 20 minutes until she showed up with one dress, size 8, she said it would be the best fit for me. Confused, I tried it on thinking maybe she knew something  about my size that I didn't, but sure enough the size 8 was too big! I waited and waited and Selina never came back to check on me, I finally had to go look for her and tell her it didn't fit, and she responded ""Oh, well thats all we have, the rest of the dresses are either really small or really big"". I asked her if I could try on a smaller size and she argued with me and then walked off, came back with a different dress in a size 6, still not the size 4 or the dress I asked for. I tried it on, and she still never checked on me, I had to find her again and tell her to bring a smaller size and she responded ""oh we actually don't have that dress in a smaller size"". I asked her how could that be, when she just said she was searching through all of the sizes and they had it in a smaller size. She then  said ""someone must have taken it off the rack and is trying it on"". After two hours of just waiting around for Selina to help me, I got no where and walked out with nothing! She just did not want to help in any way, and seemed too busy to be bothered. Save your time and go somewhere else.",0

Nothing worst than waking up one morning to find your tire flat when you've only purchased the used truck not even 2 weeks prior. My husband with my little princess in tow went to Superior tire for the very first time to have them check it out. I must say from my husbands reiteration of his experience, they are aptly named Superior, because that's exactly the kind of service you get from them. They told my husband that unfortunately the tires had to be replaced and showed him exactly where the problem spots were. Since we needed special tires that they don't normally carry in store, they told my husband they were going to send a courier to pick it up at their Northwest location to speed up the process and save him the hassle as he had our daughter with him. 

Shout out to Brian (Manager) and Mark (asst. Manager) for giving us the royal treatment and Managers discount, and to all the wonderful staff of Superior tires. Kudos to all of you for going above and beyond and for running an amazing establishment that people can run to for their needs and not be pressured about getting a product or service done or stressed about being ripped off like how other places operate. We will definitely make this our go to as far as car needs and will happily recommend them to friends and family alike. Check them out! 5 Star quality and service all the way.",0

IFKp--egnMd44KFuZJ3B6A,"I love the food here but like a lot of really good places in this area, it can get slow during lunch.  I've also heard they can get really busy at dinner time but I've only had lunch. Try the crispy shredded beef or the milanesa steak.",0
YuNWOLlG0SN0U4yz0xHhdg,"I've come here for breakfast twice and it's fantastic.  You get a delicious and filling breakfast of baked goods and coffee for very cheap! Go elsewhere and you don't know what you'll get.. I paid much more another day for a greasy omelet and toast.

The cafe au lait is good, though for my taste they use a bit too much milk.  You may want to ask them to put more espresso or less milk.

The baguettes are great, and they have for you to use butter, peanut butter, and jams.

The apple pastry and croissants are very good.

We also got some sandwiches to bring with me to the biodome to eat for lunch, which were very good.  If none of them in the case appeal to you, you can ask them to make a sandwich for you right then and there with whatever you like inside.  Thus, you have a delicious, fresh lunch that is far cheaper than going to an actual restaurant around here.

I tried macarons for the first time here, and they were fine, although considering the fact that one tiny macaron costs about the same as a large croissant, it's not worth it to me personally.  But it was good to try.

Overall, very nice place!",0
OL1j6MHUJLxd0tjmdy5sWg,"I came to this location because it is extremely close to my house.

There are 2 people working the registers and  CLEARLY one line. I've been standing here for over 7 mins to make a simple return. These cashiers are extremely slow. If you cannot chat with customers and work the register, perhaps you should try one or the other but NOT both!

It's now been another 5 mins and I'm still standing here. There's something seriously wrong with this picture. It shouldn't take 10 mins to process a 3-item return...but it has.

And for the customers who believe that they can stand on either side of the counter to be serviced...inappropriate. There is ONE line clearly marked on the floor, get in it! It should've been obvious with the two people standing behind me. Don't be offended when others, waiting to see how the cashier is going to act, state that they are next. You see other customers gathering in one line...follow suit!

The store was quiet. There were all if seven cars in the parking lot. I should NOT have been in line that long! I'll drive to Chandler before I come back here. This is a joke! 

Stay away! Stay very far away!",0

For a minimal fee he upgraded my room.  I loved the view.  He also made some excellent recommendations on what to do while in town..  Was very personable and if the line is not to long I would ask for him.,0
fl2dDM3X1tRox1hNfU8f8A,"Ok ok. My heart is for Yafo so I was super interested to give CAVA a try on my way back to Charlotte from the lake. I came around 9:30 before closing time and it was still busy! Even though they were closing they continued to bring fresh food out including new rice and fresh chicken. Plus the stuff was super friendly. 

I went with the BYO grain bowl with chicken. I love how you get to pick three spreads then any toppings you would like! I went with the eggplant, hummus and spicy crazy feta. Next on to the veggies- I topped it with tomato/cucumber salad, pickled onions, white bean salad and feta. Lastly it was topped with sriracha Greek yogurt. So creamy!

Oh my Lordy was this concoction amazing!!!!! It was also served with warm pita that was equally awesome. My bowl was full of flavor and all of my toppings mixed so well together. You can't go wrong! Ps my husband got the dill yogurt mixed with the lemon herb sauce as recommended and his flavor was so fresh! Both bowls we got had such different flavors. Mine spicy. His refreshing. You can really create anything here!! 

Best thing of all- my husband and I both gots bows - loaded it with toppings and we spent only $20 total! You can't beat that! Plus I had leftovers so two meals for one! 

I can't wait for the CAVA to come to the uptown area soon!!!! I'm a fan and will be back!!",0

9WtkpDN5W05PukpLEiCgTA,"When I was a kid growing up in Squirrel Hill, the Cage was a place of mystery for us. Who knew what went on behind those dark windows? It was probably a den of iniquity where things too terrible to talk about went on. You weren't allowed to go in and use the BATHROOM. WHY WEREN'T YOU ALLOWED TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET AND USE THE BATHROOM??? IT MUST BE A TERRIBLE PLACE.

When I went to art high school (this was before they started carding), all the coolest teachers used to drink there, and sometimes we'd come in to talk to them on Friday nights and pretend we were cool and old enough to be sitting in the old wooden booths smoking cigarettes. And then suddenly, we *were* old enough to be in the booths smoking and drinking enormous pitchers of Yuengling (or double old-fashioneds for those of us who still had pretensions towards being literary) and stumble out at the end of the night heading for Eat n' Park and smelling like the inside of a cigarette (though my allergies have gotten a lot worse of late and I'm actually starting to wish you couldn't smoke in here--I am getting old!) This is a good bar to come to on a pre-Christmas December night to hang out with friends you haven't seen in ages, and know that tons of people you know will be drifting in and out as the night goes on. This is a good bar to come to when you don't really know where you want to go on a Friday but you know you want to just relax. This is a good bar for women to not get grossly hit on in. This is a good bar to people-watch in--it's always a crowd of middle-aged drunks, university intellectuals, and other fun neighborhood types hanging around in here. It's not the cleanest bar in the world, nor the friendliest (though the bartender with the ZZ Top beard whose name I can't remember is pretty damn great), but it's just a straightforward place where what you see is what you get. 

 It's not for everyone. It's definitely for me.

Instead of a run down, hole in the wall place, this Pink's is like a blinged out version..I guess that's where our extra dollar goes to...

Bottom line is..two hot dogs and a drink came up to $26.  It wasn't even good, I took one bite and made my boyfriend finish the rest.  I'd much rather stop by Earl's inside Planet Hollywood for some amazing sandwiches for only $6!  I'll probably never get caught at this establishment again.",0

I caught a cold my GF and wanted something warm and broth like. Monta Chaya popped up on my Yelp app and within few minutes my order was placed and I was in swimming in Ramen. I normally get nervous about getting Ramen to go, this one of those foods you need eat quickly while it's still piping hot, if not, it could thicken up and be gross. This was not the case with Monta, they smartly keep everything separate to avoid a very mushy...  everything.  

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, which the broth is made from boiling pork bones. This was pretty damn good. Crunchy veggies and was seasoned very well and not over salty. Which is a common ramen mistake. Ha, That rhymes. 

I ordered an side of extra side pork for the ramen and some gyoza. The pork was super fatty and could have been cooked a tad longer, but still a great addition to the ramen. The fried gyoza had great flavor and were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just like I like em'!

I've been here about 4-5 times in the past year and I've always had amazing service sitting at the bar. As of tonight, 6-01-12, the service was absurdly bad. I don't blame the personality of the bartender, he seemed friendly enough, yet he was just not meant to be behind the bar.

The rooms were atleast twice the size of a hotel you might encounter in a New York city or San Francisco, and at half the price. My room was a suite style room, although I didn't avail of the amenities in the room it was nice to know that these were available.

The service was of particular note at this hotel. One got the feeling that the front desk staff are very talented, knowledgeable and skilled in interacting with guests. They were amazingly polite and personal. I had one of the members pull out a map and draw a walking route through downtown Montreal which I did take. It was good to see the staff take that much pride in presenting information about this great city.

Kamusi à un menu nous offrant une large sélection de ""Rouleaux Spécialités de la maison"" & ""Tapas"". N'ayant pas de réservation nous nous sommes assis au comptoir, et ceci nous a permis d'admirer le travail des chefs. La fraîcheur et les combinaisons de saveurs étaient au rendez-vous dans chaque assiette, il y avait longtemps que je nous n'avions pas mangé d'aussi bons sushis. 

Je dois admettre que nous avons été gourmands, notre sélection de 3 tapas (Feuille d'Automne, Saumon Bio en tartar & L'Art d'Aimer). 
- La Feuille d'Automne fut notre coup de coeur, un tartar de thon épicé (mais pas trop) sur un chip tempura (croustillante parfaitement), une entrée parfaite à partager en couple car il y a     2 portions, à se rouler par terre tellement c'était bon. 
- Le Saumon Bio en tartar est très bon mais très léger au goût. 
- L'Art d'Aimer une assiette de 6 tranches de sashimis passées à la torche et de la citronnelle, c'était bon mais un peu cher comme entrée.
Nous avons dégustés 3 ""Rouleaux Spécialités de la maison"" (Arc-en-ciel, Désire & Hiro). Chaque rouleaux ont 4 morceaux chacun, ici on ne mise pas sur la quantité dans l'assiette mais définitivement sur la qualité et la fraîcheur des ingrédients.
- L'Arc-en-ciel & le Hiro furent nos préféres, ça fondait dans notre bouche tellement c'était frais et savoureux, tous bien dosés.
- Désire était bon mais j'utiliserai le même commentaire que pour celui du tapas, le saumon bio est bon mais peu goûteux.
- Puis nous avons aussi commandé (2assiettes) de sashimi, le thon à queue jaune "" Yellow tail"". Wow ! de belles grosses tranches épaisses (3 par assiette), c'était comme croquer dans du beurre tellement c'était frais.

Excellent service, des serveurs polis et attentionnés, des chefs sympatiques mais discrets.
Les assiettes arrivent l'une après l'autre à un rythme paisible (sans pour autant être long) nous laissant le temps de savourer chaque plat. Une adresse qui me réconcilie avec l'art de manger du très-très bon sushi à un prix plus que correct. Nous avons pu se permettre un peu de folie avec le vin car c'est un ""Apportez votre vin"" (BOYO), au final, nous avons déboursés $115.00 pour deux, comprenant les taxes et le pourboire pour ce magnifique repas
Beau restaurant (environ 50 places), beau décor, très bon service, excellent nourriture. Tout pour nous rendre heureux. Nous y reviendrons sans faute.",0
gBP9905yL6NspXstz-LLwA,"I never heard of Matt Goss but was invited to see his show with hubby and friends and WOW best decision EVER!  I am NOW a ""fangirl""!  

Matt is an amazing singer/ songwriter and the show at Caesars Palace is nothing short of spectacular!   What stage presence Matt has and you can tell he is really enjoying himself and thus drawing the audience in!  Plus he is CUTE ;-)
Even though I didn't know his own original songs I was snapping my fingers, clapping, and ""singing"" along.  I bought his CD and got it signed and even got a pic with him after the show.
Matt's band, back up singers, and ""Dirty Virgins"" dancers are all talented as well!

4dyQIC7gOj5dmuBrwX19Mw,Working on 3 years here and the last year has been mortifying - I reported an stolen car - manament response was to put a note on the car with a bogus apartment number on it - when I attempted to locate the apartment guess ...didn't exist. When you sign a lease you are told if you have  a party and the police are called you are evicted - well when ASU graduates who live here decide to throw a party where police are dispatched 3 times - it doesn't apply to them. The grounds were once well cared for are in a mess and  they brought out palm tree trimmers who dropped palm branches all over my car because the manager was to lazy to disperse notices so you could move your car - she had 18 hours but didn't feel up to running up and down the stairs. The laundry room isn't secure and for over 100 apartments you have 7 washers that only work sometimes - and then you have those who leave their laundry in the machine for hours....Threats from residents..... Now she is taking section 8 and the ghetto is marching in....leaving and soon,0
rG6F8vQixj4Q5tPMhHNX2Q,"Had an odd experience with Hertz at the Charlotte Douglas airport. The service was very good but the signage is misleading and the system of getting to your car is weird. If you follow the signs for hertz you end up in the hertz gold club booth with 2 employees waiting to assist gold members and lost customers. Over the span of 5 minutes we watched them redirect 8 customers and assist 0 gold members. Afterwards we found a hertz representative who was able to assist, we sat through the spiel declined the up charges and then we were told that our car was at G-1. After wandering through the park lot like lost boys from Peter Pan, we were told by a parking lot representative that cars are brought out to everyone. We were just hoping to find the car and leave but instead we waited in a line of confused costumers for our car to be brought out. It took about 10 mins, not terrible but we would have preferred to just get the car ourselves and not be so confused about the process.",0

Ok so we were party of 8 ordered our meals that came in separate times also few of the orders were cold (i guess the food was sitting while the server was busy. Busy? Busy doing what? The restaurant was half empty.
We wanted to drink water so we had to mention it few times before we actually got water,  needed more pitas, same problem we had to mention it few times before it was served cold.
A bit pricy for the portion,  they need to adjust their prices about %20 less then their current prices. 
Also they adding %18 service fee on the total. 
Had to mention the free sangria also twice before we got it.

Xt8uyAgU1XnV57elNORmhQ,"This place is close enough to one of my bases in town to be able to order take-out and save the delivery fee, which is only a couple bucks if you're feeling lazy- but they add an additional charge if you only order a small pizza.

The pizza isn't bad, but it's not outstanding either. The toppings are usually decent, but we've had issues with them throwing unwanted anchovies onto our pizza and denying it when we called them about it later and trying to convince us that it's not an issue.

A small pizza with 2-3 toppings can wind up costing you between $14-17 plus the delivery fee. 

The customer service can be spotty. We've been made to wait while the owner talked to one of the employees and our pizza sat behind the counter getting cold.

cdZixRfAQry2c5BzwIVxjA,"The Wife and I were heading to a 7:30 show and wanted to give Kings Kitchen a try.  We set a fairly early 6:00 reservation and we were one of the first groups in the restaurant that Monday night.  
The server appeared promptly (maybe a little too much so) to take our drink orders, so we put him off just a bit while we perused the wine and beer selections, which were pretty good.

When we placed our dinner orders I let the waiter know that we had a 7:30 show, no big hurry at that time, but better safe than sorry.

I had the Fried Chicken that has gotten so many good reviews, Mac and Cheese, cabbage and mashed potatoes.  My dear Sweet Wife went with the Fried Flounder Filet, Collards, Mac and Cheese and mashed potatoes.

OK, here's where I'm supposed to complain how everything fell apart, we were late for our show, and I died from undercooked chicken.....but none of that happened.

Our meal arrived promptly, but not so fast that we did not have time to enjoy our drinks a little before eating.  The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with a nice crust.  Try as I may, I can't seem to cook chicken, so I appreciate it when someone gets it right.  The cabbage had good flavor, not watery, as you get at many restaurants.  The mac and cheese?  Well, it rivaled my Wife's (sorry Babe), and she makes really good and unhealthy mac and cheese with lots of cheese and cream.  Mashed Potatoes?  Biscuits?  Done right.

The flounder was breaded with the same sort of crust as the chicken instead of a corn meal breading.  She said it was very good.  A big portion of collards were well done.

We passed on dessert because the main portions were plenty.  

All in all, we had a good experience.  We had plenty of time, but we weren't rushed by the staff. Of course Monday at 6:00 is not a busy time, but by the time we left several parties had arrived and the place was pretty busy.",0

From the outside it peaked our interest - there aren't many hotels you drive up to with a bright green and blue/white striped exterior. Then we saw the electric vehicle reserved spaces in the parking lot, which again is pretty cool. We walked over the circle drive asphalt of the typical gray-black mixed with surprising sparkles of blue rock, and into the lobby, which was already getting noisy from the crowd at Gallo Blanco. Our first favorite thing about the Clarendon is the front desk. The uber nice front desk lady not only offered us cold water bottles free of charge, she also got us some of the complimentary goodies. Here's bonus point #1: Your $20 a night service fee for the room not only includes parking, gym access, and internet (like a lot of hotels), but also long distance calling, and the desk has free cold water bottles, nutrigrain bars, Kit-Kats, Reece's

hUs8zSb6UYDk119JqzbKOg,"What an awesome paint store.  I'll be honest, I didn't even know about this place until I googled auto body supplies and found it just a couple miles south of a different paint shop that I usually go to.  When my usual place dropped the ball and couldn't even make me paint on a Friday afternoon, these guys came to my rescue.

I needed paint mixed on the spot and these guys pulled it off.  I'm not a pro, just a DIY / enthusiast - but I've been to a few paint stores and know when I see quality products.  One of the first things that caught my eye was their SprayMax products - best stuff you can get out of a spray can, hands down.  What's even better - they can mix your paint for you into a Spraymax can ready to shoot.

I ended up buying a Spraymax can to do a door jamb and got an extra pint that I was going to shoot out of my gun.  Everywhere else people were forcing me to buy a whole bottle of reducer for which I'd end up throwing away because I don't do that many projects, but these guys were very happy to mix it in for me ready to spray already out of the can.

This is definitely the place to go if you're looking for Sem or Transtar products - they have a bunch in stock.  The paint they mixed for me is by Valspar. Hard to find a friendlier bunch of people that are willing to deal with small project guys.  They offer some really good advice and stock some quality product.  I'm definitely going to come back here for all my painting needs.",0

yvRi5KedO9_jh7JPYylzsw,"What used to be a Madison tradition for college students and those looking for a fun gameday place has become an atrocious dump.

I went there last Sunday with my wife to watch some football on their big screens upstairs, and boy did it not take long to make us leave.  For starters, we went to the bar upstairs to order some drinks and food, only to have the bartender be fairly rude and gruff when we asked questions.  He looked like a normal college-aged guy, but apparently he must have been hungover or something because he just didn't want to provide any kind of service what so ever.

After paying for the food, my wife went back up to ask if they put a charge hold on the card because she remembered this from her time at college there, and it turned out they did.  I had no idea about this, and the bartender never mentioned it before I paid.  So it turns out, they put a charge on your card for FIFTY DOLLARS if you pay for anything with it.  The reason is to ""make sure you have money in your account"".  It's now four days later, and that charge is still sitting on my bank account, tying up money I could have used for other things.

During this whole process, I was obviously a bit upset but I was calm about it because we wanted to just watch the games and have a good time.  Sadly, the volume on their speakers was set for Rave level, and I was going deaf from the noise level rather than being able to have a conversation and watch the game.  There were literally five people in the place, so I don't understand what they were gearing up for.  One of the big TVs was on ESPN while the other one was on the game, so I went up and asked if they could change it to one of the other football games that was on.  The bartender said it's going to happen (again gruffly), and eventually changed it to a game.

We finally got our food.  What used to be some of the best Madison Cheese Curds are now some over processed orange heap of nuked badness.  My burger looked like it had come out of a turnstyle vending machine.  Neither of the items tasted any better.

Got up and left at this point, won't be back again unless I'm really really really drunk.  Which, granted, is probably the only time it's worth patronizing this pile of an establishment.",0

The ""chasing the glove"" part was not necessary as I was completely entertained thru out the entire show. My 6 and 5yr old enjoyed the characters running around and acting silly because they had no idea who Michael Jackson was! 
Seats are great wherever you sit in section 102. There were speakers in the head rest which was very loud. Ushers brought over extra cushions for the children for better viewing..

Well done Vegas, yes I would see it again! I cried, laughed, said wow a few times, and left feeling like Michael Jackson actually meant something to my childhood.",0
HzOn6KoHbxsilEHgYaA1Ng,"I have had several visits to this store.  As a single woman these guys have helped me each time.  One time installing wiper blades, one time doing diagnostics, and today was my second time purchasing headlights.  Today, Greg helped me, and he installed my headlights with a smile and good humor about it.  He helped me pick out the right bulbs and was just kind all the way around.  This store is somewhat out of my way, but I will continue to bring my business here.  Thank you.",0
5QENdW3tuCcdnIx3HwD4hA,"This place is AWESOME!

I've driven by quite a few times and always remember it's there once I am past the center.  I've been meaning to stop in for quite awhile now, and finally made it in today.

It's rather large, and everything is very well organized.  There are housewares, purses/shoes, sports equipment, clothes of all sizes and styles, and furniture.  There is also a room dedicated to books/cd's/dvd's, which is probably the most organized I've ever seen at a thrift store.

I am not sure why anyone would say that this place is over priced.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  We found everything to be reasonable, and they reduce things even further as the week goes on (today the blue tags were 50% off and the black tags were 75% off).  They also offer 40% off to those with a valid military ID on Mondays and a senior discount for those over the age of 55 on Wednesdays.

I discovered today that the staff are all volunteers, which is awesome, because you know that the money from sales is going to the cause, not to overhead from paying employees.  The sales are also all tax-free, since this place it a charitable organization.  They are associated with Central Christian Church, so some profits go there to help the food bank, and others provide counseling and work training to those in prison.

There were lots of great items, of good quality and we found a few things to buy.  Both my Mom and I decided that it was the nicest, most organized thrift store we had been to in quite awhile.",0
WxP7LRPiXCBHy3zLqA-0fw,booked the place. they put us on the last room before they remodeled entire hotel. find out the last day. wasn't pleasant experience,0
XW7yxv9wHU0jMBOB9_rX7g,"Have to agree, what started off as really great turned into a nightmare and glad we no longer live in this shit hole. First off the staff, Chris and Nolen were great and really got things done, the new people are lazy and incompetent. Charlene, the short Mexican is lazy, rude and doesn't understand the simplicity of a smile. To say this for is downright unpleasant is giving her too much credit. 

The grounds are decent enough thanks to the actual hard working maintenance crew, the noise level started off good until they allowed people noisey college kids who do not know what quiet hours mean. Partying until 3-4 am on a weekday. When explaining to office staff who already doesn't do any work, they don't do anything about it. Literally said there is nothing we can do. How about your job? Nope! Nothing is down! 

getting in your rent in just ONE day late because you work for a living and couldn't make it in you have to pay an additional $160 late fee! Again ONE day late! 

To say I would recommend this place would say I recommend having all your wisdom teeth pulled while having a lobotomy done. Stay away from this apt!!",0

The place is horrible.  We stood and waited for the hostess while she was chatting.  Her pants were too small as was her top and she had to keep pulling her pants up.  I thought that I was in a strip joint, she had so much skin showing between her pants and top.
We finally got seated.  On a Saturday morning, there were only about 6-8 tables with people.  They were small groups of two, besides.

Scotched Egg was perfectly cooked and flavored with a great crust.

Perfectly chilled Guinness to bring it all together.

eec8UPL7f4bMsusuJbKzmw,"HALF ORDERS FTW (for the win)

I love this place even more now because I just discovered they let you order HALF SIZE for the fatties that can't decide between two orders! Lol instead of 4 egg omelette a you can request 2 eggs which is what I did with my Mexican Omelette. Soooooo smart!

Mexican omelette: 5/5 Really cheesy and good! Dollop of sour cream on top went good with the red enchilada sauce and jalapeños. 

Island dish: 5/5 Hawaiian dish Portuguese Sausage link with two eggs (we got over easy) and scoops of rice. The flavor of the sausage was deliciously salty!

Banana Pancake: 5/5 Wow. The bananas were sweet and the pancakes FLUFFY! Damn good. I got a side of this and it was my perfect dessert. 

Banana nut muffin: 5/5 FREE when you check-in on YELP! 

Thank you for the delicious food and for the awesome service! 5 star everything!",0
OGKMXUGb5Cs60hq9N3l34g,Everyone at this location is very attentative and polite.  I reallly liked the wood decor and the modern way the restaurant is designed. The food was very good. The 1.99 handrolls are large and worth way more. I got the sushi lunchbox and that was tasty as well.  The dressing has a bit of hot spice that was just ok.  The main reason i am giving 4 stars is that the music was really loud especially for a lunch crowd. It made it hard to talk to the other people at the table. In the restrooms it was twice as loud.  Five stars if they can turn it down a bit.,0

Couldn't say enough great things about this place!,0
2KpSmW8CZKfYNUmhRS0qaQ,"Really wanted this place to be a winner. 
We tried this place twice before- this is our 3rd time. Never wrote reviews b/c we hoped we were just experiencing one of their ""off days"". 
Reason for my rating : Too inconsistent and doesn't taste like ""Soul"" food. 

We ordered a Full Slab of ribs twice - received 7- 8 ribs both times. For those that know about ribs, know how many is a slab... Not sure what they're doing but either way I should AT LEAST get 10 ribs... Don't just completely insult my intelligence!

The ribs are either tender and meaty on some days or fatty and chewy on others. I don't like the inconsistency. 

Um next, the corn bread- it cries for milk and sugar -tastes like airy cornmeal and water...

Potato salad- The first time was pretty good- which is why we ordered it for the 2nd time but it was too chunky. Then ordered again for a 3rd time just to make sure the 2nd time wasn't a mistake and it again was too chunky. I'm talking too chunky like I had to chop 1 piece of a potato into 3 smaller pieces. 
Which one is it, chunky or nah?

The Mac and cheese tasted like like a doctored up box of Velvetta Mac and cheese. 

Again this food is classified under ""Soul Food"".

Maybe sell grilled steaks and burgers and become an all American restaurant b/c your sides aren't good. You can't call it Soul Food just because you sell Mac and cheese, collards greens and corn bread. Soul Food is apart of culture just like Mediterranean or Asian cuisine.  Soul Food might be the wrong category for this one or at least my soul thinks so",0

We went upstairs to try out a few beverages and a little bit of eats. Mark is the bartender up there and he is everybody's friend. A rare talent.

jB1Jaw0BOonkoB7MRM48Lg,"Horrible place and by far the worst salon experience to date. I went there to get my hair ombred. I showed the hairdresser a picture of what I wanted. It didn't have to be exact, but I was expecting something close.. boy was I ever wrong. Instead of the blonde gradual ombre I wanted, I got an orange colour on the tips of my hair. Not only was the ""blonde"" an actual hideous orange but my hair was FRIED, done. Took me 2 years to grow the horrendous, damaged hair out. Pretty sure she just slathered bleach on my head and didn't take into account that I have very fine hair which means it bleaches faster than any other hair types. Best of all, the stylist did not even blow dry my hair. I could barely see what this looked like until I got home. I paid $200 for a mess of a dye job that I probably could have done better at home and to leave the salon with wet hair. Worst salon ever!!!!!!  I went to another salon 2 days after to fix my hair (after my ..""ombre""... I don't think you can even call it hair). Would not recommend unless you want your hair ruined for a couple years.",0
2-J6yJNXSzaZvPHpInHSXw,"Well it's clear that I need to check out what people have to say on Yelp before I use a service like Showtime Tours. If I had taken the two seconds required to read these reviews, I never would have used them!

My experience was very similar to what many other people experienced. I was staying at Planet Hollywood with some coworkers for a conference, our flight was for 7pm on Friday night. So the shuttle scheduled a pickup for 5pm. Plenty of time, right? Well not when the shuttle doesn't show up until 5:30!! It was a very stressful sitaution needless to say.

The savings grace was our friendly and apologetic driver. I wish I had gotten his name, he was hte only good part about this whole experience, and only because he owned up to how late he was. I hate to give negative reviews but unfortunately Showtime Tours deserves one.",0
tkRwhOMw0ByI434O9etMeQ,"This review is strictly for the Las Vegas Suites property management company and not the MGM Signature Suites hotel. Las Vegas Suites manages certain rooms in this hotel and we had the misfortune of staying in one of them on our recent trip to Vegas. Staying in a room managed by LVS is a MUCH different experience than staying in a room that's actually part of the MGM hotel. 

The reason we booked this stay to begin with was because we had stayed here previously and had a great experience, but we stayed in an MGM managed suite.  This time, I booked the room through Expedia and didn't pay attention the small print when I paid for the room (does anyone really look at that stuff?) Big mistake on my part.

Upon checking into the hotel we immediately noticed a few things that were instantly different from our last stay. First of all, when I made the room reservation, I specifically stated through Expedia that we wanted a room on a high floor away from the elevators. My wife and I are very sensitive to noise and, having travelled extensively, know that rooms near the elevators tend to be the noisiest so we wanted to be as far away as we could. The front desk person told us that not only had they booked us right next to the elevator, but we were overlooking the pool which has a dance party every day from 11am - 5pm. She didn't think it would be a big deal though as the room was still not very close to the elevator doors and you couldn't hear the music from the party with the balcony doors closed. We asked to switch our room, but she said since we had booked through LVS we had to contact them and they wouldn't be open until tomorrow. 

When we got into the room we instantly saw several things amiss:

1) The room features a guest bathroom with a shower stall which my kids were going to use since they were sleeping in the living room. The floor of the shower was filthy with black dirt particles left over from who knows how long ago (see picture)
2) The sofa bed mattress that my kids were going to be sleeping on had huge holes and gashes on the bottom that looked like Rats had been gnawing on (see picture)
3) The wireless phone in the living room didn't work at all
4) There were stains on the living room carpet underneath the coffee table (see picture)
5) Furniture in the unit had holes or visible signs of wear (see picture)
6) The outside balcony was filthy and looked like the glass had not been cleaned in some time (see picture)
7) Not only did they put us in a room that was overlooking the pool party, but we were directly adjacent to a construction site that started work every morning at 6am (See picture and video)

Now, I understand that hotels can't predict when construction is going to be going on next to their property, but you would think that someone scheduling the rooms would look at our request and think, ""hmm these people don't want to be near the elevator - they probably would like a room in the quiet part of the hotel."" I seriously don't think anyone actually looks at those special room requests anyway so it was probably just wishful thinking on my part.

There was also a sign in the room that was essentially a menu for cleaning services. If we want to have the room cleaned on a daily basis it would be $50, if we wanted clean towels it would $20 - yes, that's right $20 for clean towels. I considered us lucky that they granted us an extra roll of toilet paper in our unit. Who knows how much extra that would have cost? I did see in the small print on our itinerary that there would be a $50 cleaning fee based on the size of the unit, but again, I've never stayed in a ""hotel"" that charged for cleaning so I didn't pay any attention to it. I guess that's the last time I skip the fine print.

When I tried to call LVS the next day I spoke to a fairly rude woman on the phone who told me that she was sorry, but they were fully committed and couldn't move our room and since no special requests had been made for a quiet room they couldn't make any concessions for us. I asked if her if there was anything they could do as far as maybe giving us a discount or a food and beverage credit and she flat our refused.

Basically, what we learned is that when you stay in a suite that's managed by LVS you are completely on your own. We even tried calling down to the front desk for a pair of scissors one night and were told that since we were not hotel guests they couldn't provide us with one. 

If you are looking to stay at the Signature Suites do yourself a favor and book directly through the hotel. Las Vegas Suites is a sorry excuse for a company that only cares about their bottom line and couldn't give a rats ass what their customers think.

Oh, and Annabelle R., don't bother writing a snarky response to my review as you have done with everyone else. It just makes you and your company look guilty and desperate to cover up your faults rather than trying to appease an extremely unsatisfied customer.",0
n9oHRtA2xqC-lO7wb3MMfA,"I live in Las Vegas so I go to Mt. Charleston a lot in the summer since it is 20 degrees cooler, and in the winter you have snow that you can enjoy and get back home in a jiffy!  I stayed at the resort and I had a fantastic time, I got the coupon in my Valpak coupons! It was so fun, we arrived got settled in, we had a small balcony just right for the two of us! The rooms are kinda cabin theme, if you want luxury there is plenty of that on the strip.  We then went on a small walk with the snow settled on the ground, it was refreshing and beautiful! We returned ha dinner and had a drink at the lounge, what a nice atmosphere. This is a great getaway, for us on a budget ... so close and so different from the desert! Love it!",0
pN73XmnJwudwLm6gZG-Wwg,"A bit disappointed. Thought this would be a cool place with lots of seating and a lounge vibe.

Arrived and realized it was tiny and overhyped - it's just a glorified Taco Bell done up Vegas style that serves alcoholic mixed drinks.

Bf and I walked in, looked around, said to each other ""that's it?!"", then left to go eat/hang out somewhere else.

The place is decorated in lounge style, dim with colored lights, music booming loudly. Have to admit it looked kind of cool.

Size wise, it's tinyyyy. Literally like, a little corner shop tucked away on strip. We walked by and missed it the first time. It gets crowded lining up waiting to order, merchandise stands take up space. Cramped seating both inside and outside.

Nothing really special here, save your time in Vegas and go somewhere more unique and fun!

Servers  could barely hear our order, conversation was a shouting match.  The couple next to us left because of it.  A table next to us moved and had all of their food shifted to a table near the front because they couldn't take it.  The food here is fantastic but would rather opt for take out than to return.  It's that ridiculous.

Crazy fun fact:  We went to see a metal band play across the street at Coalition after.  We both agreed that the metal show wasn't as loud as the stupid dj at dinner.  There's your reference point.  It's louder than being at a metal show.

I asked that the driver stay at the airport to pick up my boss regardless of how long it took, and the dispatcher committed that would happen.  His 7 pm flight ended up arriving almost at midnight, and the driver was there to take him to his hotel.

FS4T6ShZC63tXN7wjrnPCA,"Came here for a Meetup during Happy Hour with a group I belong to.  Since it was suggested by someone who happens to be a waitress here, my view of the excellent service we got may be a bit skewed.  But judging by the number of wait staff attending to diners on the patio, which was packed by the time we left, I don't think so.

We sat inside, at the back pub tables in the blissful air conditioning.  My drinking buddies were taking advantage of the happy hour prices and imbibing freely, while I was content to nurse my two glasses of wine, one more than my usual.

We were lucky to be at Hennessey's on Tuesday, when burgers are 2x1, so hubby and I eschewed the appetizers and chewed instead on some tasty burgers.  Good quality.

We'll go back again (this was, I think, our second visit), especially after learning about the good deal to be had with the pub dinners for $10.95.  The burger was excellent, so I expect we'll be happy the next time, too.",0

dIN0UhWTmUFA3dqEACiSQg,"Where to start?


I like this mall. I much prefer it to Richmond or Beachwood, however, I chose a very bad day to visit.

1st the good. They have a Spencer and a decent food court.  They have all the stores I want to shop at and the sales tax is less than the Cuy.  Oh Fuji the Japanese place is pretty dam good.  Lunch special for 10 bucks choose 3 rolls plus soup and salad. The staff at this mall are pretty friendly and actually ask if they can help me. Lots of parking!

The Bad:
 The mall  is located in Mentor. Ever been to Mentor? It is a cultural void, Soccer Mom infested,  soulless, chain store infested suburban wasteland.  I have never seen such a concentration of Italian and pizza restaurants. Here is how it goes while driving, Chain store, Italian restaurant, gas station, tanning place, fast food restaurant, pizza joint, rinse and repeat.  It is obviously very sunny here as a lot of younger people have tans. This place used to be farm land many moons ago!

The Ugly:  
The day I came here there was a competition for singing the National Anthem.  I love this country  but to hear this over and over made me want to put a bullet in my head. This was probably worse than water boarding.  I mean it's not an easy song to sing and half these people had no business even trying it.  They seem to have all these free cars that you have a one and a bizzilion chance of wining. All you have to do is give them your personal information.",0

But one would think that it would be possible to clean the air better so you don't smell everyone that smokes.   I have no problem with people smoking that is their business.  But I have to believe there is a way to clean the air better.  You can't get to your room without walking through the casino.

ODPAHPfhc0lNKegGTU_zGQ,"Boneheads is a pretty cool place for some really great food! What a great local find in the area!

I actually found out about this place via Groupon. They had an offer for $10 for $20 and I love seafood and I love chicken so I bought it figuring what did I have to lose!?

Well I must say I was not disappointed! When you walk in the doors you come right up to the menu and counter and the cooks are back there whipping up amazing fish, shrimp and chicken dishes right before your eyes....and that's enough to make your mouth water....because it looks so delicious!!!

So we decided to try a couple of there top favorites, the staff was very helpful with their top favs and helped make our decision much easier!

For starters we had the Bonehead's shrimp which are Crispy fried shrimp tossed with Boneheads sauce and served over cilantro slaw. The shrimp were cooked until golden brown and then tossed in to this delicious spicy and sweet sauce that was a perfect pair....they were soooo delicious! I almost wish we had a second order!

I chose the taco combo with the tilapia, shrimp and chicken....I figured I might as well try all three so I could compare and have plenty of variety! There is no issue with portion size here! All the tacos are filled with the meat and slaw and a side of your choice! The tilapia was cooked perfectly and full of flavor you could really taste the different spices they used to add extra flavor. The shrimp again were delicious, and covered in a seasoning blend and sauce mixture....the only thing I would add is some of the special signature Boneheads sauce...that would have made these tacos complete!!! Finally the chicken was really good too! Very tender and juicy! The tacos came with a side and I chose the fries, they were hot and prepared well just lacked seasoning and crunch in my opinion. Next time I would prefer a vegetable option. 

My boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineapple salsa topping which has 
pineapple, peppers and onions mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce. The salmon presentation was beautiful, I loved the grill marks and the taste was wonderful, it was flaky and tender and the sweet sauce added a nice combination of flavors for the fish. For the side, he selected the grilled zucchini which was sooo yummy!!!  Again, gotta love those grill marks! These are definitely a must try! 

This was a great visit, I loved food and the flavors the portion sizes and just everything here was great! I look forward to coming back!",0
361Fpvf1BHs6KAl1JmLxRQ,"I wish I could give it zero stars.  I've never even worked out at the gym.  My husband, baby, and I signed up to work out together. We found out the next day my husband was being sent out of state for work for a few months.  We cancelled the day after signing up, only they never actually cancelled our account.  I contacted them about it and the operations manager was supposed to be fixing it.  I never got a resolution from her so I contacted her again and found out she no longer worked there. Victor Barazzo called stating he was fixing it and even said he got it taken care of and my balance was now $0.  Next month comes and I get a call from the collections company, ABC again.  I have tried to get back in touch with him again with no luck.  This has been since August and not only has no one fixed it, no one has even bothered to cancel my account STILL.

xFzAaw_5Su0a0YDZLcQy9w,"I have been a customer of Lowe's for over 10 years BUT no more after this experience.  Their customer service is horrible and they fabricate the truth frequently. I ordered over $2000 in items and have had to call them no less than 6 times in a week.  They promised my delivery would arrive on the 15th and I'm sitting on hold again for the 7th time for them to tell me when my order will arrive.  I've been on the phone today for over 30 minutes.  Each of my calls lasted just as long. They use vendors but don't communicate that at purchase so they can't control when orders ship.  They charged me already for my purchases but I haven't received them and told me that's the way they do special orders.  Lolol. How about keeping all the items and providing a full refund.  I will never shop at Lowe's again and will happily share my experience to warn others to stay away!!!! 

I have been on hold now for 45 minutes and the lady told me they need 24 hours to figure out what's going on with my order. Hilarious!  I am now waiting for a MBA agent as 24 hours is too long to keep a customer waiting who was supposed to receive something 4 days ago.

The one thing that stands out in my brain is the way the place made me feel. I felt like I was important as a customer. I went in a Starbucks fan, I left feeling like I could be both and Dutch Bros would be happy for me. 

This is a great company. It makes people feel good. I have to go back and research the drinks more. I ordered a sugar free hot cocoa, I know it was hot, but that is always easy to order. 

I forget what Brad ordered, sugar and more sugar, with coffee in there too. Anyway he liked it. 

I read thru the drinks. One caught my eye. The Tuxedo. Basically a dark chocolate and white chocolate drink. I have had this under a different name in Taos, Starbucks served it one new year, but no I can no longer order this drink. When I ordered in Taos it was not sugar free so it was a rare treat. Now I have hope I can order it sugar free whenever I want it. We shall see.

We had a fixed menu with the first course being baked goods, not made in-house. it took an hour or more to get just those baked goods. It took us another 45 minutes to get our food. And when asked if they could rush the cake at the end (all they had to do was put in on a plate) the kid plating the cake sat there contemplating how to do it for at least 5 minutes. When the lady who made the cake asked if she could plate the cake (which meant just taking out out of the box and putting it on a plate) she was given attitude. So not impressed. This is place used to be a fav but not anymore especially for a party - they clearly can't handle the volume. And we were only 9 people. Also no one needs hipster attitude.",0

maCeCr64fm2uRA5HFntg5Q,"I was in the market for a new car and Liberty Buick had a used 2014 CRV EXL that I was potentially interested in. That's where the good part ends. All down hill from there. 

I got stuck with Dylan, who seemed pretty nice at first. But then during the test drive he turned out to be a complete jerk. My dad and I were asking him questions about some of the features on the car, and he was so rude. ""I don't know, guys, it's just a normal car."" Aren't salespeople supposed to try to SELL cars? And if you don't know something, just tell me that you'll find out. Don't ignore my questions. Definitely was not gonna drop 20k+ on a purchase with this type of dealership. 

Then when we were talking pricing, he told me he would ""get me a good deal"" - his definition of this was ADDING $2000 to the price we agreed on. Do I look stupid? I obviously researched the value of the car before going in. Then he had the nerve to ask me ""Is this good for you?"" I flat out told him ""no"" and walked out of there. 

Every second at Liberty Buick was torture and I made my way out of there real fast.",0
MEEDrtGar4hE6lagVk-_iA,"Nothing special about this store. The customer service isn't that great, the guitar department really isn't that helpful, and the guitar techs at both stores don't know jack sh*t about guitars. They're just getting paid to re-string guitars for people that don't know how to do it themselves and overcharge them for it. You're better off taking your guitar/bass to a REAL tech. People are even saying on here that the drum department sucks too.

Not only does it seem like they never have enough people out on the floor to help assist customers on a busy day, the ones out on the floor appear lazy and honestly seem to not really know what they're talking about for the most part. Mainly high school kids with the slightest clue about stringed instruments or drums. The older guys who work here really are no better. Even on a slow day these employees seem lazy when it comes to helping a customer.

If you're going to sell them a used piece of gear like a guitar, try craigslist first as you will most likely get offered a bad deal at this store. 

Also played through a used amp they had out on the floor only to notice the speaker was blown out. I let one of the employees that was out on the floor know that the speaker was blown out and he didn't seem to care at all, just shrugged it off. Same lazy attitude that half of the employees seem to have at this location. ALWAYS test the gear out before purchasing. Asking to use an amp cable or power cord to test out a piece of gear to make sure it is in working order may save you a lot of money making sure you're not buying something that's damaged or broken. And they won't tell you weather its damaged or broken.

If you check online at the guitar center website for an item available in store, call the store before hand to make sure that they have what you are looking for because this store is famous for saying they have an item available in-store online, then you get to the store and they don't have what they said was available. Samash will always be the better of the 2 stores.",0
S0y0_Ga-V76q9UEM_GBH5g,"I love this Cleveland Metroparks location! And not just because it's practically in my back yard. Acacia Reservation is a former golf course with golf cart paths as trails. There's flat and hilly terrain and some beautiful scenery. It's been cool to watch the park transform from a manicured golf course to the wilderness.

There are a few ponds within the park where fishing is allowed. It's not my thing, but I always see families hanging out by the water.

There's also a facility on site available for rental. I had the opportunity to check it out for an event and there's a very nice bar area and a few rooms that seem perfect for smaller functions like showers and birthday parties. On site catering is provided by Dino's, and their food is generally pretty good.

Jhvg9J5a3P5pwddvImrQyw,"We're Rolled Ice Cream fans (this same chain from Summerlin)! We were excited they opened one up on this side of town. We no longer have to travel too far to have it.

Just a couple gripes. I don't like the set up here. Once you enter, you think the line is its normal length from the one end of the room to the entrance, just like the other location. Instead, there is no line to place your order. You go straight to the cashier surpassing the long length of people who already paid, but just waiting to be called up for their order to be made. 

I felt stuck, even though I'm sure I could have asked for a refund if I wanted. As opposed to just leaving a line once your impatience bell rings lol. I also didn't like how our 4 separate orders were made in 3 different sections by different people. It was hard to keep up with my kids who each wanted to watch their ice creams being made. 

I like Summerlin's set up where you stand in line and wait to be helped. You place your order with your one guy, and they take care of the whole thing for you, then you pay at the end. Prices are just a little more at this location. There's a loud and pretty obnoxious worker at this location that swore he was a Japanese teppanyaki/hibachi worker. Too boasty but as I watched, he wasted his energy more on his trying to interact and entertain than making the Rolled ice cream to the ""Rolled ice cream"" standard. His rolls kept falling apart.

We gotta show love to Benecio and Shakira though. Benecio went straight into it and perfected my rolls of ice cream. My husband was in disbelief with how good Shakira's rolls were too lol. We'll definitely be back, maybe when it's less busy. I'm hoping they can change their set up to be like Summerlin's. We still enjoy the flavors and the experience in general.",0

After being called and alerted on the app that my prescriptions were ready, my inhaler still wasn't ready 6 hours later due to their shoddy system and apathy. My insurance company confirmed that everything was fine on their end ( after the pharmacy lied and said they were waiting in my insurance to go through) and Walgreens refused to call their help desk to sort out what I'm hoping is a systemic error. This is the norm at this Walgreens and it's close to my house so I didn't want to go elsewhere but since they think a person with asthma can wait for an inhaler while they try to conceal how bad they suck I don't have a choice but to delete them as my preferred pharmacy despite their huge presence.

xziww1TerQOTsAKkS34dgA,"When I originally went in to get my kids costumes the dressing room staff was very friendly, which is why they are not getting 1 star. But that day I went shopping I forgot my coupon. So today I went into to refund the costume and repurchase with the coupon. Which they told me was possible. There was another item I had to pick up while I was grabbing that item, I guess its the manager Sherrie comes up and says she needs the original product. I had the receipt in hand and was willing to show her the exact costume. But that wasn't good enough I needed to show her the one I had in original package. Ok not a problem I have it hung up in my daughters closest unopened. Then Sherrie mentions that she not trying to say I don't have the product that she just needs to see it. Basically its still a I don't believe this product belongs to you bring it to me. So I drive home grab the costume and bring it in. Well I walk back in hand her my stuff she grabs the receipt and says I need the card. I have multiple cards so I ask to see the receipt so I know which card it was on. Well turns out the one time my husband uses his card was this day. So I told her that my husband paid if I can use my card that they are the same account she says no she needs his account. So I offer to call him and get the card number she says no. Pretty much seemed like she is just unwilling to help me at all. Her response just seemed like she didn't believe that this was my purchase and I was someone trying to get money back. The sad thing is I wasn't trying to get any money I needed to buy other products and trying to save a few bucks. So I ask whats the corporate number she claims she doesn't have one. Very frustrating moment which the manager or whoever she was made this customer feel very disrespected and will not ever shop there again. She needs to learn how to treat her customers.

Their color selection is pretty good, but not great. They seem to be very clean establishment, and everyone is very friendly and accommodating. You don't get that everywhere.

But they're not very careful about shaping the nails as meticulously as they could. I often come out with slightly misshapen nails. I don't know, maybe I'm really picky. But when I do my own manicure, my nails are absolutely perfect. And who am I? Just a lowly citizen.

I think the thing that did it for me was a recent gel manicure. The technician applied three thick coats of color and to thick topcoats.  This results in a very uneven and slightly wavy surface, not to mention a very thick nail. 

By contrast the other salon I went to recently did an amazing gel nail for me. Extremely clean and very meticulous about shaping the nail. Also, he applied two very thin layers of the gel polish and one topcoat. There was no overflow up on trying. They were absolutely perfect and just as tough as having had five coats applied.",0

It's located right by the Science Center gate and there's a guard that wont' let you drive through, but there's a small parking lot just for Pizzeria Bianco.  
I visited on a Tuesday at around 11:45 with 1 other friend and the place was almost full.  We started off with the the Spiedini which is a fontina wrapped in proscuitto on a skewer.  It had the right amount of bite to it.  They also brought out some house bread with some olive oil.  We definitely cranked out some pepper on top of it and we couldn't stop eating that.

The salami sandwich was a big portion, glad we ordered this as well.  With the sandwich being cut in half you can see all the different components that came together.

Since we couldn't decide on a pizza we were told the Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy were the popular choices.  And any of the other options without protein on it could always be added on with an extra cost.  We stuck with the margherita and it was great.

Food came out fairly quickly.  The service is great and the staff is attentive with refilling drinks and checking up on you.  The menu isn't a phone book like many other places so you can tell they've perfected the ones that they have listed on their menu.",0

the entire experience from start to finish was SOLID! our driver Steve picked my family up from our hotel on time as scheduled. he was very friendly, put my mind at ease and his knowledge about not only firearms but college sports was very IMPRESSIVE :)

Ryan was our instructor and not knowing what to expect (my emotions ranged from intensity to beyond frightened) i can honestly tell you that i would not have been able to complete my session had it not been for his knowledge, patience and assurance that i GOT THIS!

i plan on visiting Vegas again but this time specifically to take shooting lessons with Ryan - thanks guys!",0
iRF2WuCJKPScrUhhpXuMNQ,This is hands down the best pizza on the strip. You have gotta find this place no matter what. All I will say is that place is located in the cosmopolitan hotel on the third floor where all the restaurants are! Go find it and order the white pizza! You will not regret it!!,0
e357wYEnEXMReePkNSVbKw,"Went in for a lunch bite. I got a cabeza taco and a lengua taco. The meat was seasoned perfectly. My wife got the cabeza and pastor taco.  The salsas at the salsa bar were right on point. The red was spicy, the green, my favorite, had a kick and excellent flavor. We will be back.",0
JBlSyldbF5yvJm5_ZdqdSQ,"Just left Chick and Benny's ordered a salad with chicken which said on billboard was $2 more please see photos, then ordered a nest with slaw.  My bill came to 18.38, what  a ripoff.  Last time I went here had a group-on buy, same lady behind the cash register did not credit it, I paid $10 she charged me the rest, even though should have been $20.00 had to take it in to her 3 weeks later  and complain, she then credited my credit card.  Do not buy groupons to this place, they will try their best not to credit them.  Today, although they have great chicken tenders, really $18.38 for six, a basic salad and small cole slaw was a waste of time and money, will never return and urge you to see what you get for the money.",0
WR0nKG3pV6Vdp-hC6z-oOg,"Advertised as the best sushi in Vegas, I had to try it, plus it was close to the hotel. After reading reviews on yelp, I knew that I was going to order the sushi cupcakes. Their main thing is sushi burritos, but as I wasn't that hungry and the burritos looked huge, I opted for the cupcakes. 

The sushi cupcakes comes in a set of 4. It comes with 1 spicy tuna, 2 crab and 1 smoked salmon. I chose to do 2 spicy tuna and 2 crab. The cupcakes are situated in a wonton wrapper which I didn't care for. The crab had sriracha, avocado and cream cheese. The spicy tuna had spicy mayo, eel sauce and a cucumber. 

 Both were good and tasted as you would expect for a fast food joint.",0
Ke4c00XJmNZp2si8g2inaA,"Yum! I got the taro smoothie with extra bubbles - it was perfect! My friend got the coconut milk tea w/ regular boba. Hers was kind of watery, but mine was great.

The atmosphere in there was weird; the employee wasn't very friendly. Maybe it was because we were literally the only ones in there. I don't really like the starkness in there, despite all of the drawings on the walls. 

The drinks were good and decently priced. I'll be back!",0
UBZLsg9NrCet7mSfFinY-A,"I work downtown and had never discovered the Crescent Ballroom as a business lunch venue until about six months ago. I like to experience a place a time or two before reviewing. After three visits, I must say that this place is worth your time.  Service is irregular (I ran out of water three times) but the food is quite good and uniquely Arizonan with southwest flair.",0
Qr_wgGRx5cgWnWVKvBOnmQ,All I can say is YUMMMMM. Great sangria and have the bruschetta sampler to share. Hummus one is my favorite. Per other reviews I had the shrimp tacos and they lived up to the reputation. They are great. Finished everything off with coconut flan and another sangria,0
vdkRNHARLlTM4vg9oeKSkQ,"The Food was fresh, healthy and filling. I have been there three times since they opened.  Each Time, I give the food five stars. However,  everytime after I order, at each station, I have to constantly repeat my orders back to the workers and this is very ANNOYING when you have ordered 3-4 meals ""Yes, I ordered two kids meal, one with chicken strip, and fruit cup, and one with soup and fruit cup, and I ordered the Italian club with soup, and my husband ordered Pulled pork, and etc""... at each station.... Yes, I did this everytime I stopped in.  

Maybe a suggestion is to do what Einstein does, is take your order at the first register (install a register at the order counter maybe?) and cash you out at the end, this way, employees aren't asking you at every station ""what did you order?"" and they have some sort of direction in the back Unfortunately when you are hungry and cranky already by the third time an employee ask you what you ordered, I want to reach over the counter and pick up my orders myself, and move it to cash out.  The flow needs a bit more streamlining but otherwise I am still a fan of the food.

5 stars for the food becuase I do like light meals, not huge portion, so its perfect for me.
3 stars for the lack of organization behind the counters but good efforts.",0
nN75h60VWMNrcAATaIMNlg,"This Buddyz's location recently opened ... and it feels it. 

Walking in I was immediately greeted with 2 large tables of screaming kids. IMO the front bar area should have a partition from the main dining seating so adult customers can have their own space. Couple this with to-go orders and all the servers congregating around the bar ... yea the front of house currently revolves in pure chaos. Not a space I will frequent unless the owners can iron that out.

Getting past the front door the Chicago style Pizza tastes really good and they have a nice selection of craft beer on tap. 

I'll be back.",0
ww7C3ura223ohf-UuuvsIw,"I was pleasantly surprised! My husband and I stopped by to check it out and have dinner. Very yummy, with a great price to go along with it. We played a little bit and had some cocktails. The bartenders were very nice, great personalities. Bekah was funny and made great drinks. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing night out.",0
Z2GQUoo97Ly62vAyw942VQ,"The food and service is great! The guy behind the counter doing food prep was generous with his samples and very personable. The lady who rang up our order couldn't have been more kind. We had gyros, grilled chicken salad (juicy chicken and a yummy sauce!) and baklava...all very delicious and very well made. Love this place!

HOWEVER: painfully slow! I'm sure that's because it's freshly made, and I'm in a hurry today, therefore I won't complain about it. Just know that our simple two person order took 25 minutes, which for a mall food court, is pretty slow. Not someplace to eat when you're on a time constraint. So come a but early and enjoy the excellent food here! We will definitely be back.  :)",0
0LDH_j5s02PHMobGY6oa4A,"We came here on a Monday night and had a lot of fun. It was a little hard to find because it was down the hallway, but it was kind of nice that it was in a separate area than the casino. Once we were in line, they were pretty efficient with checking guest list and getting us inside. 

Once we were inside, we grabbed some drinks and headed to the dance floor. It was nice that they had a dedicated area in the middle just for people who want to dance. There were quite a few people, but it wasn't overcrowded. It was easy to spot the restrooms and to make your way over to them from the dance floor. And the place had great airflow, so it didn't get hot inside the club.

The first DJ was pretty good. Then another DJ started a set, and we weren't feeling it, so we left. My one complaint was that we had to walk quite a ways to get to the taxi stand to get a taxi back to our hotel.",0
uYawzdNX3iMhx8eiZxN0KA,We dined a few more times here and the food is still great. The molcajete is really a bargain and plenty of food for two even when split into a half order. Some tables are located near ceiling speakers and the music is lively so that might not be for everyone.,0
ImLwh0H_tlY3ItcnazUb9A,"Wanted to grab a bite and some drinks while watching the eagles/redskins game. The lodge was close so we went here. First impression was good. We were greeted by our bartender Chris and asked what we were having and if we were hungry. Chris introduced himself and his partner behind the bar Mitch. Drinks came, food came, good night right? This changed as we waited 25 minutes for a another drink. I had two drinks over the course of three quarters of football and had to ask for the second. The bar wasn't packed at all and yet it seemed tasking to get a drink. This was until we had no plates, no drinks and were waiting for our friend to finish his 3rd beer, which he had excellent service throughout the night. Not saying Mitch and Chris are bad bartenders, everyone has an off night. Just concerning as we were told this place was good to go. The highlight of the evening was our ""chef"" who kept checking on us and had a great personable interaction with us all night.",0
8XHHgFbwURavjx0NDyrLkA,"Okay I walked in and was pretty confused about what to do, this being my first time at a Jason's Deli. Thank god I my friend had been there before and directed me to the small cashier booth near the back of the place so we could place our orders. There's a pretty diverse choice of sandwiches, soups, and salads here. Also there's free soft serve ice cream. Who doesn't love free ice cream?!

Our orders came out fast, but I asked for no tomatoes and ended up picking them out of my sandwich. Also when I order a sandwich toasted I kind of expect the inside to not be cold. It kind of throws off the whole texture for me, you know? That being said their sandwiches are huge! It was almost too much meat stuffed into the slices of bread, because I had to take bites from each side so that it wouldn't slip out.

The ambiance I would describe as noisy, and corporate. That's not really an issue though when you are just grabbing a quick bite before heading to a party as I was doing, but for sitting down and enjoying the surroundings I'd recommend somewhere else.",0
UXaToHJ3KcbaW73rwwtDmQ,"Pretty good pizza for a quick bite. Same concept as Chipotle, Subway or Cafe Rio. Choose what you'd like, they make it in front of you and then cook it quickly. 

We ordered a Caesar salad and a chicken BBQ pizza. The crust was thin and crunchy with a little char you come to know and love like your local pizzeria, the BBQ sauce was flavorful and sweet and we received it all in a timely manner. I wouldn't recommend ordering from this place for take out. I think their food is better eaten on site. 

It was a bargain for less than $20. I think one pizza and a salad for two people was just the right amount of food.",0

hKzldhWQGuAbBi4_qMBwIw,"This is a place to go when you want to drink and watch games. The service if you're a girl isn't great and if you're a guy isn't great, but the flirting should distract you from crappy service. My brother didn't get his food for an hour and my avocado burger was ok. The fries are disappointing since I love fries so much. On game day the parking isn't free, it's $10 per car. They wouldn't change the games that were on due to their ""Sunday policies"" that make them leave all the games on the whole time even if the crowd didn't want it. Overall, it's not bad if you want to watch games and drink beer.",0
-ME6kZw10bh3P3oqHPfAJQ,"Note this store is now located on Elizabeth Street just south of Dundas.

Owner is a really nice guy, very helpful for a person like me who knows not much about cigars.  Nicely laid out store, very pleasant place to drop by.

mKnQ23uqlLsi-HjbU7ZatA,"I recently moved to Pickering and dreaded having to find another hair dresser. My thick black hair is not easy to cut properly, especially how I like it. So after finding this place I decided to cautiously try it out. The result? Right on the mark with the first try. I was very impressed with how quickly Nadar, the hair dresser and owner, delivered exactly what I asked for. No more trepidation. I'll be coming back again.",0
3XYqp6BCqXIeXeLutAvrWw,18 days and counting with no word as to when our stuff will arrive....Trying to get someone to call you back is almost impossible.  I hope the rumors I'm reading are not true but I'm starting to have my doubts.,0
yPoP96WoCfVRovpfSUo3Tg,"I have gone here for 9 straights years. The service is top notch. When you come in they seat you right away, and the server always checks on your table every 5 minutes. The menu is great, so many selections to choose from. The food is fresh and outstanding! You should try the award-winning ""French Onion Soup"". What a amazing selection of IPA Beers they also have. I also love the decor. They serve lunch and dinner. Highly Recommend!!!",0
iHlPbx6gy1lbtbgJpgMpug,"Went back here recently with friend in town who loves Indian food.  The food was EXCELLENT as always.  We ordered 4 naans and about 5 entrees, and enjoyed them all immensely.  The bullet naan was thick and filled with tastiness.  The peshwari naan for dessert remains one of our favorites.  We also enjoyed a dal, and some other vegetarian options.  My friend asked them to cook the dal in oil instead of butter and they happily obliged.  

Regarding some of the 1 review wonders who complain about how terrible the service is or how they have gotten sick...I have eaten here at least 15 times and neither myself or anyone with me has ever gotten even a mild upset stomach, and the service is always friendly and good.  

For those who miss the restaurant.com certs (as I do)...the waiter told us (might be the owner) that they are planning to return to restaurant.com, so watch for it I guess.  ALSO...I printed out a coupon from moneymailer.com (I think thats the site...google saffron flavors of india coupon)...it is the site that runs those envelopes of coupons you get in the mail every couple of months or so.  Anyway, you can print the coupon from the site directly and take it in..it was $10 off 40 or 1 entree free with 1 purchased with 2 drinks.  It isn't restaurant.com, but it helps.",0

nhx74vX_apXXctCNI1CpXg,"Went here for dinner on a weekday night, we first ordered the lettuce wraps and the Cobb salad for appetizers which tasted great. For dinner our party of 3 ordered the tandoori wrap, the BBQ brick chicken and the BBQ chicken pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza did not taste very good, but the staff was excellent in changing our order and brought us the warm steak salad instead which tasted great!
Smash has an impressive staff and a diverse menu, definitely a place to check out in the GTA",0
Beea3Hfg5F409I3G1qG5FA,"I really enjoyed this studio. I went for a Vinyasa class and it started very promptly at 5pm. The instructor was good and very nice but not as warm as most yoga instructors, possibly more rehearsed. She was still very effective though and I felt great at the end of the hour. 

I also really enjoyed their store. They had great books on yoga and meditation along with dozens of stones, pendulums, incense, and all kinds of knick knacks for embracing your inner yogi. There's no place in Calgary like it that I know of. When I mentioned to the clerk that I didn't even know the store existed all this time she replied ""that's because you were meant to find it in your own divine time"". I love that. 

They also have customer parking in the back which is a huge plus since it's located on 17th ave SW. Worth checking out for sure.",0
